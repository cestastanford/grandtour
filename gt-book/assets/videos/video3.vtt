00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Built in Palladio, this dynamic graph allows viewers to explore the architects' education data.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
One can filter by each of the seventeen educational institutions in the data, or by educational background,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
into which educational institutions are grouped as art schools, other universities and colleges,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and Oxbridge and Inns of Court, to which we added the category "Training with an individual."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
One can zoom in to analyze individual architects' education paths, but also see aggregate trends.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For example, you see the five architects, Thomas Hardwick, George Hadfield, Willey Reveley, Joseph Michael Gandy,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and Thomas Johnson, who both attended an art school and trained with an individual.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There's only one other case of an architect with two educational backgrounds, and that's James Gibbs,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
who both trained with an individual and attended one of the universities and colleges in the data set.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Interacting with the graph overall, viewers can easily grasp that we have education data for three-quarters of the amateur architects

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
compared to less than half of the professional architects,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but also that the professional architects are represented in all four types of educational background,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
while for the amateurs, we see only two, the socially elite Oxbridge and Inns of Court, and other colleges and universities.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.800
