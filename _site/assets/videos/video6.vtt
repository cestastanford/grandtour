00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
For fifty-two of the architects, we collected data about how they finance their travels.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This information about funding sources is divided into the five categories of

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
commissioned work, independent wealth, private sponsorship, architectural family business, and scholarship.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The interactive graph reveals these dynamics of the economy of travel, both in individual stories and in aggregate.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Amateurs mostly funded their travels solely by way of independent wealth,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
while most other architects combine multiple funding sources, as revealed by the many overlaps among the groupings in the graph.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The one amateur not appearing in the individual wealth group is Sir Andrew Fountaine,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but not because there's an alternative data point for him, but rather an absence of information.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
There are two instances of scholarship, a support mechanism that started appearing in the 18th century,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
both of which appear together with commissioned work.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.500
