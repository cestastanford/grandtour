**Birth date.** This is the four-digit numeric data category that represents the year of birth of the travelers. It is complete for 2,439 travelers, meaning that the year of birth is known and recorded in the database for less than half (around 40.6 percent). For around a quarter of these, the years of birth are qualified by word markers that indicate some measure of uncertainty or approximation, such as *circa*, *by*, or *after*. These markers are string data. In the Explorer, the markers are visible, displayed next to the year of birth in the left column of travelers&rsquo; individual entries. In the tabular download of the data from the Explorer, they are recorded in the column &ldquo;markers&rdquo; next to that of year of birth.

**Birth place.** This is the placename of the geographic location where a traveler was born; the data ranges in specificity from a town name to that of an entire country. This is string data, appearing as words in the Explorer display and in the downloaded tabular format. Birthplaces are sparsely known and recorded in the database; there are only eighty-four unique locations, accounting for 132 travelers&rsquo; births. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#birth-place).

**Death date.** This is the four-digit numeric data category that represents the traveler&rsquo;s death year. This data is complete for 2,672 of the travelers, meaning that the death year is known and recorded in the database for just under half (around 44.5 percent). For eighty-two of these, the death year is qualified by word markers indicating some measure of uncertainty or approximation, such as *circa*, *by*, or *after*. These qualifying markers are string data. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#death-date).

**Death place.** This is the placename of the geographical location where a traveler died; the data ranges in specificity from a town name to a country name. This is string data, appearing as a search field on the Explorer page, as well as in words in both the Explorer display and the downloaded tabular format. Places of death are sparsely known and recorded in the database; there are only seventy-one unique locations, accounting for 320 travelers&rsquo; deaths. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#death-place).

**<em>DBITI</em> Employments &amp; Identifiers.** These are the terms in the *Dictionary* that describe travelers&rsquo; endeavors, achievements, interests, and defining characteristics. They are listed after the traveler&rsquo;s name and any recorded biographical dates but before any further biographical information. Around one-sixth of the travelers in the Explorer have these brief descriptors; 914 travelers share 212 terms, and many have two, three, or even four such identifiers. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-41).

**Education.** The database contains education information for 1,202 travelers&mdash;that is, around one-fifth of the total travelers (just over 20% percent). In most cases, it indicates primary and secondary schools, colleges, universities, or other specialized institutions (whether religious, legal, or artistic). At times, it includes degrees obtained and attendance dates. There are also cases of travelers studying under specific teachers or apprenticing with specific experts&mdash;most often, this is the case for artists and architects. In some cases, only the education location&mdash;given as the city or country&mdash;is recorded. This education data is structured around the categories of &ldquo;Institution&rdquo; (there are 107 institutions for 1,639 records), &ldquo;Place&rdquo; (there are sixty-nine places for 1,734 records), &ldquo;Degree&rdquo; (there are twelve types of degrees for 146 records), &ldquo;Teacher&rdquo; (there are ninety-six teachers for 123 records).

**Entry ID.** This is a numeric data point expressing the unique identifier assigned to each traveler entry and connecting all data pertaining to it. This entry ID remains constant throughout the database and its exported file formats. The entry ID allows one to confidently move across different fields, filters, and data categories in the Explorer or manipulate data from downloaded tabular files without losing track of which travelers are being considered. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#entry-id).

**Exhibitions &amp; Awards.** These are records for the art exhibitions in which travelers displayed their work, as well as any prizes and educational fellowships they were awarded. There are 419 records for 147 travelers in the database. The data consists of the institution names that hosted the exhibitions and granted the prizes and fellowships, as well as any specific awards received and the relevant dates as available. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-65).

**Gender.** This is string data for a category that tags each entry as *female*, *male*, or *data not available*. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#gender).

**Marriage.** The database contains marriage information for around one-third of the travelers. This data consists of spouse names, marriage year, and (when a traveler remarried) a sequence number. Within this clearly defined tripartite structure, there is much variation. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#marriage).

**Mentioned names.** These are the records of people mentioned in others&rsquo; entries. More than four-fifths of the traveler entries have at least one mentioned name. There are 24,234 records for mentioned names, totaling 6,502 unique names. Out of these mentioned names, 4,323 belong to other travelers with an Explorer entry ID and account for 19,053 records. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#mentioned-names).

**Military careers.** This category lists the ranks for travelers who served in the military, with 723 records across 265 travelers in the database. This large discrepancy hints at how many travelers with military careers&mdash;more than two-thirds of them&mdash;held multiple posts as they rose in army or naval rank. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#military-careers).

**Occupations &amp; Posts.** This data represents traveler occupations and posts as listed in the *Dictionary*; these range from political appointments and honors to trades and crafts. The Explorer data records around 256 such positions and professions for about 25 percent of travelers in the database (1,522 of them). Often the records of these occupations and posts are accompanied by additional information, such as dates or places. Sometimes this additional information consists of details like the names of people for whom travelers worked or titles of books they wrote. Among the myriad biographical data in the Explorer database, this is one of the most varied and rich datasets. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-47).

**Occupations &amp; Posts: Group.** These are the eleven groupings that gather thematically related occupations and posts for easier interrogation of the data. This is the list of these groups, starting with the most populated in descending order. Click on each to read more about it: [statesmen and political appointees](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-48) (887 travelers); [army and navy](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-49) (301 travelers); [diplomacy](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-50) (203 travelers); [scholars, academics, authors](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-51) (178); [clergy](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-52) (154); [artists, architects, craftsmen](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-53) (77); [law](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-54) (49); [domestic service](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-55) (46); [finance and trade](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-56) (37); [patrons and founders](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-57) (31); [physicians](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-58) (28).

**Origin.** This string data point explains the origin of each digital entry, with three options: &ldquo;From the *Dictionary*&rdquo; indicates entries reproduced as they appear in the print *Dictionary*; &ldquo;Extracted from heading&rdquo; means entries newly created by dividing an entry whose heading in the print *Dictionary* includes multiple travelers; and &ldquo;Extracted from narrative&rdquo; means entries newly created by retrieval from the narrative of another traveler&rsquo;s entry&mdash;that is, &ldquo;hidden figures.&rdquo; [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#entry-origin).

**Parents.** This data gives the names of the parents of travelers when recorded in the database. There are 3,110 records for 2,462 travelers, meaning that for 648 travelers, both parents are recorded. For almost a third of these records (1,151) there is an Entry ID, meaning that the parents are also travelers in the database. In some cases, the data includes additional information, such as order of birth (for 1,323 records, expressed as a numeric value or an abbreviation for older, elder, younger, or youngest), or the notations of &ldquo;surviving&rdquo; (228), &ldquo;heir&rdquo; (54), &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; (25), and &ldquo;posthumous&rdquo; (3). [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#parents).

**Societies &amp; Academies.** This string data represents the cultural, scientific, and artistic associations for which there are records of affiliation in the database. There are twenty-four societies and academies, for which we have 695 records of affiliations relating to 501 travelers (around 8.3% of the total). The records also include the role played by travelers in these associations and for many of these also a temporal dimension, whether expressed as a single year or a range of years. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-62).

**Sources.** These are the records for sources referenced in the entries, consisting of published and archival material titles, that appear in the *Dictionary*&rsquo;s footnotes and extensive bibliography. There are 545 sources, and a majority of entries (sixty-nine percent) reference at least one, across 11,164 records. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#sources).

**Travel date.** These are the records, a mix of numeric and string data, of the time spent by travelers in each visited place. Records are organized around arrival and departure dates. Each one is designed to contain a day, month, and year of both arrival and departure; but in many instances one or more of these data points are left empty or qualified with &ldquo;markers.&rdquo; Uncertainty and missing data are features of this category. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#travel-date).

**—tours.** A tour constitutes the combined records of locations and dates that represent a traveler&rsquo;s journey to Italy. The tour data consists of a tourIndex and tour dates. The tourIndex is a numeric value assigned to each tour a traveler has taken in chronological order, starting with &ldquo;1&rdquo; and increasing sequentially. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#tours).

**—visits.** These are the various individual records of stops constituting a tour, each record centering on a place and time of visit. The structure of this data is built around an arrival date to and a departure date from a certain location when known. [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#visits).

**Traveler name.** These are the names recorded for the travelers in the database, varying from cases of a single surname to multiple names, including at times titles and other terms. There are 6,577 records of names for 6,007 travelers. This discrepancy points to travelers with multiple recorded names, labeled in the database as &ldquo;alternate names.&rdquo; [Read more](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#traveler-name).

**Travel place.** These are the records, as string data, of the places visited by travelers. There are 431 locations in the database. Of this total, the great majority of travel places, almost two-thirds, are located in Italy. Of the 150 locations recorded outside Italy, many are in England.
