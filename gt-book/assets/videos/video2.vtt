00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This interactive visualization makes it possible to compare architects' travels in terms of both destinations visited and time spent in these places.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Note that all 130 destinations are still represented, albeit with a different principle than their geographical coordinates.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
When viewers type a location in the search box, only the relevant travel segments are activated.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For example, when typing Florence, only the orange bars pertaining to travel to Florence for all of the architects will appear.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Moreover, hovering over the bars displays precise details for each stay in Florence.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:51.000
For example, for John Talman, viewers will see his first stay in Florence dated November 18, 1709 to April 1710;

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the second, January 1722; and the third, July to October 1715.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The chart uses thirteen different colors with each of the 130 locations assigned to one of them.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Ten of these colors represent the 10 independent states into which 18th-century Italy was divided.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
By dividing our travel locations into colors pertaining to different 18th-century Italian states,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we circumvent the issue of the fluidity of certain regional boundaries.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
For six of the states, we created a darker shade to indicate the capital city.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The same darker shade is used for the category of vicinity.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This avoids distorting the reality that most Grand Tourists had long stays in the main Italian cities from which they completed and recorded day trips to local
destinations.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Three additional colors stand for categories that are not political but crucial for understanding travel patterns in the world of the Grand Tour.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:07.000
First, we assigned beige to all instances of travel where we know the tourist was in Italy with no further specification of visited places, such as for most of John
Groves' travels.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Secondly, we assigned grey to all the destinations beyond the Italian peninsula.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Sicily received its own category colored in brown.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The island was politically part of the kingdom of Naples for most but not all of the century, yet stood separate in the habits and imaginations of 18th-century
travelers.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Several measures of time are included in the time chart of travelers, showing both the place and date of each segment of travel.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
On the left side of the chart, the architects' names are lined up from top to bottom in the chronological order under which their travels occurred.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
At the beginning of each travel bar is the first year of travel.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:04.000
For John Talman, this date is the year 1699, and for Charles Tatham, the last architect traveling in the century, the date is 1794.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We listed decades to the left of the names in a column, placing them next to the first traveler in that decade.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
This helps readily identify at which point in the century a traveler is located and the density of travelers per decade.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Therefore, viewers can discern immediately that the 1750s and 1760s were the two most traveled periods.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000
At the bottom of the visualization is a bar marking intervals of 12. These are to be understood only as approximations of months.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000
We use the month as the minimum measure. That is, whether one stay amounted to a day or a month, it would take up the same portion of the bar.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Here, there is inevitably a distortion.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:05.000
For example, we know that Reveley spent the end of February to the end of March touring Puglia, but because his detailed records list as many as fourteen destinations,
his trip appears longer than a year.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Parentheses following the traveler's name contain the numbers of places visited, and a dot following the traveler's name indicates that the traveler took multiple
trips to Italy.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
When viewers click on any name, they deactivate the relevant bar.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It's easier to compare the two Mylne Brothers trips after deselecting the trips of Byres, Newborough, and Hadfield.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Finally, when clicking on the Highlight Amateur box, the twelve amateur architects appear in relief, bolded, and distinguished from the others so that viewers can
appreciate at once how amateur trips differed from professional in terms of places visited.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:58.000
The amateurs travels are multi-color, rainbow-like, reflecting that their journeys were more similar to typical Grand Tourists with the resources to visit
multiple places for shorter times.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:13.000
The case of someone like Soane, who has a more rainbow-like travel pattern, reflects in turn that he travels further than Rome in accompanying one of his wealthy
patrons, who could sponsor his more varied and costly journey.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
This is an example of visual argument, what we're able to discover by visualizing the data.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:30.000
