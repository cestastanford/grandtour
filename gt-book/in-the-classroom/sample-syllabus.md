The class I teach about eighteenth-century travel to Italy using the Grand Tour Explorer is titled &ldquo;Virtual Italy: Methods for Historical Data Science.&rdquo; It is an undergraduate class, upper-division by catalog number, but regularly also attracting some first-year students who thrive in it regardless. By a mix of general requirements that the class satisfies and, I want to also imagine, by word of mouth or interest, it attracts both dedicated humanities students and computer- or data-science students. This mix is constructive, adding to the learning environment in discussion and project work alike.

I offer here a few notes on what has worked well in my experience, as well as a stripped-down syllabus built around the quarter system (which is short!), with two eighty-minute weekly classes.

The course description emphasizes the importance of reading and original project-based work using a variety of technologies but requiring no prior coursework. It makes clear the weekly structure: one day for lecture/reading/discussion of eighteenth-century travel, the other day focused on technology, with weekly assignments that build on the previous class&rsquo;s readings. It also states that the making of the final project is supported step-by-step, from proposal to final presentation, starting with the midterm, and that much class time is to be dedicated to working on the project. A written submission, alongside visualization and a presentation, is expected for the final project. Group final projects are encouraged.

A visit to the library special collections to see and hold manuscripts and printed eighteenth-century travel accounts has always been an important part of the class, making concrete what the records of the past consist of and the materiality of recording travel. This component can work even in the absence of a rare books room populated by eighteenth-century travels, especially given the close relationship between the emergence of the museum as a signature modern institution and the world of Grand Tour travel. Even guided online searches for objects and books serve the students well. While some eighteenth-century collections remain proprietary&mdash;and the Adam Matthew Digital Grand Tour website, for example, is an expensive one that not every library can afford&mdash;more and more is becoming accessible in open access.
