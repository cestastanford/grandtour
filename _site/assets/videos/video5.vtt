00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For forty-eight architects, we collected information about architectural work and other employments and honors.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We grouped this data into four categories: member of parliament, knight, military work, and lastly, official architectural.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Official architectural covers all cases of remunerated architectural work, be this private or institutional, including service on committees for public work.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The graph reveals both individuals' trajectories and aggregate trends.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Official architectural is the most populated category, while Edward Lovett Pearce is the only architect to populate all four categories.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:57.000
No amateur appears in official architectural, but they comprise five of seven MPs, meaning that 41% of amateurs were MPs versus just 3.5% of professional architects.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The two professionals here are Robert Adam, famous for his successful social advancement through architecture, and Pearce, a member of the Irish parliament.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Knighthood was more common as recognition of extraordinary service for professional architects, yet only the amateur Lord Burlington was elected a knight of the
Chivalric Order.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Under military, three are amateurs and two are professionals, Pearce and Stephen Riou, who trained as an architect after a military career.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.000
