  h1 The Grand Tour

    p In the eighteenth century travelers from north of the Alps flocked to Italy, for “the most interesting of all possible voyages,” as the Abbé Gabriel-François Coyer put it after his own journey in 1763.

      | Dotted with the monuments that northern cultural and social élites knew from their readings of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and populated by influential contemporaries who might be encountered in the flesh, the Italian peninsula held out the promise of an educational rite of passage rooted in humanist ideals of classical origins. The story of the “Grand Tour,” as this journey was known, is the story of nations as well as of individuals, and as such it holds enormous cultural and historiographical significance today. To study it, to think about its participants and to re-create their pathways, is to encounter an increasingly diffused learned community whose travels helped shape the modern world as we know it. This was a community of travelers consisting of the Enlightenment’s most sensitive minds and influential writers, of reluctant youths and intrepid women, of scientists and artists – the crossing of all of whose paths led to exchanges and interactions that contributed to a massive reimagining of politics and the arts, of the market for culture, of ideas about leisure, and of practices of professionalism.
    p Yet the Grand Tour also poses an historiographical challenge. Our grasp on it today is constrained by the documents, widely dispersed, through which we can know it. Not that there is any shortage of texts in existence that can tell us about the Tour: many travelers kept journals and wrote letters, of which a number were published; and these published “travels” were themselves shaped not just by ancient texts but also by previous travelers’ accounts. Yet even these texts account for the travels of only a fraction of those who voyaged to the peninsula in these years. So while it is understood that the Grand Tour was a widespread phenomenon, with numerous individuals traveling across a vast geography, and that this long reach is a crucial feature of its influence, the fact remains that we barely glimpse its totality when we define and understand it through the writings of only a small selection of travelers. As we swim in the catchy, oft-reproduced quotations of the Grand Tour’s most prominent participants, we remain blind to the actual numbers that constitute its formative impact on modernity.
    p Our digitizing and visualizing approach to “Mapping the Grand Tour” begins to address this nagging historiographical problem. By digitizing and visualizing John Ingamells’ 1997 prosopographical

  h1 The Explorer

  .article.text-serif
    p This is the first version of the Grand Tour Explorer application (private beta), which will be updated and transformed as we continue working on it, but exploring data from Ingamell’s Dictionary can begin now, by way of multidimensional searching and browsing of the database.
    p Here is a short description of the application and how it is put together. The travel data is complete and organized by place and date of visits. We also have rich data from the wealth of biographical information drawn from the first, more schematic, paragraph of the Dictionary’s entries. We have organized this biographical data in various dimensions (Dates and Places of birth and death; Parents; Marriages; Mistresses; Education; Societies and Academies; Exhibitions and Awards; Pursuits and Situations; Occupations and Posts; Military careers). We have yet to record aristocratic titles, and think of ways of systematizing information on children, and marking women versus men travelers. A big effort has gone in collecting and sorting information about travelers’ careers and occupations, and we have grouped ‘Occupations and Posts’ into ten further dimensions (Scholars, Academics and Authors; Clergy; Physicians; Diplomacy; Statesmen and Political Appointees; Law; Artists, Architects and Craftsmen; Finance and Trade; Patrons and Founders). We are aware that this grouping represents our interpretation of the data (of which written explanations are soon following), and also that, given the fuzzy nature of the bits of relevant text in the Dictionary, some types of occupations might still have escaped our parsing. All these dimensions that we have in the Grand Tour Explorer can be searched and faceted to allow multidimensional cross sectioning of the data.
    p Please keep in mind that the database does not include information from the extended narrative sections of the Dictionary’s entries. For example, in our database, only two travelers appear to have traveled on the Radcliffe Travelling Scholarship (recorded in the ‘Exhibitions and Awards’ dimension). In fact there are three more individuals in the Dictionary who were recipients of this scholarship, but this distinction is only mentioned in the extensive narratives of their travels, which we did not include in our parsing--this is also why we have made sure to attach the full text of the Dictionary’s entries to the database’s entries, and to render it searchable throughout by way of  “free search.”
    p Two important things to take away:
    p 
      strong This application is an explorer. 
      | It is a tool to search and browse a rich dataset, with results that might well be points of departure for further searches (starting with the free search within the full text of the Dictionary’s entries, while also remembering that the Dictionary itself never was a complete record of what happened--we do not claim to know all the travelers or all there is to know about them!).
    p 
      strong The application is still under construction. 
      | This is a reason for why the access is limited to your group (along with copyright issues that will be sorted out as the final design takes shape: please do not share your login information with anyone else). This also means that mistakes are likely to be there (hopefully only a few!). These might be spelling mistakes or imprecise data to be corrected (please let us know if you see any). It might also be that in coming weeks better ways of doing certain things will become apparent as we engage with this tool in research. Improvements and changes will occur—and they will be communicated clearly.
