      In the eighteenth century thousands of northerners traveled to Italy for a journey of cultural and symbolic capital called at the time the Grand Tour. These travels were a formative institution of modernity, contributing to a massive reimagining of politics and the arts, of the market for culture, of ideas about leisure, and of practices of professionalism.

      In this volume Giovanna Ceserani, Associate Professor of Classics at Stanford University, makes public the work she directed, transforming the more than five thousand entries in the Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy (compiled by John Ingamells from the Brinsley Ford Archive) to create a dynamic searchable database, along with digital visualizations, of these travelersâ€™ journeys and lives; essays, and teaching material.
