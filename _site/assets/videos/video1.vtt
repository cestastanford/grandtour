00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Built in Palladio, the map of travels with a time span filter allows viewers to explore various dimensions of the travel data.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The map on top gives an immediate sense of where the sixty-nine architects traveled.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
All destinations in the data appear on the map as dots, covering most but not all of Italy.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Note the much more sparsely covered south, and expanding beyond Italy to places like Spalato,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.000
on the other side of the Adriatic coast, and Athens and Greece, as well as to locations in Asia and North Africa.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The map also visualizes quantitative information from the architects' data.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The dot sizes are based on the number of visits to each destination.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The more visited the place, the larger the dot.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And hovering over them displays the place name and number of architects from our data who've traveled there.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Below the map is a timeline.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Here, every thin line represents an architect's travel, and its length corresponds to duration,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
while the time sequence at the bottom orients its measure of time to its respective place in the century.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Hovering over the lines reveals the name of the relevant architect.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
These lines become readable as marks of individuals.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Moreover, the interactive aspect of this visualization expands to the relationship between the map and the timeline below it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
If a viewer selects a section of the timeline, only the travels relevant to that slice of time appear on the map above it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Viewers can run through the timeline across the entire century, watching the animation show who traveled where,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and with many dots appearing and disappearing, becoming larger or smaller in a reflection of travel trends over time.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
