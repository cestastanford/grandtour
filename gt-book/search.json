Renaldi was a British painter of Italian parentage who had trained and exhibited in London. He had also stayed with Jones in Naples for three months in 1781 and would later spend ten years working as a painter in Bengal, before returning to Britain and painting this and other portraits of the Jones family.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Jones, Marchi and Renaldi were friends, and part of a network of painters with connections to the British Grand Tour in Italy. While Marchi (and even Renaldi, who was born in Britain) escaped the focused attention of the compiler of <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em> (compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells, 1997), <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4067\" target=\"\\_blank\">Reynolds</a>’ and Jones’ entries provide at least some mention of these two Anglo-Italian artists from which one can build a sharper picture of the interconnectedness and movement within the <em>Explorer</em>. These portraits of Thomas Jones frame a life which began and ended in Wales, but they hide the hybrid origins and cultural identities of this trio of painters, as well as the nature and depth of their lived experiences in Italy and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>On 11 March 1783, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jones</a> wrote: “I had been now for some time infected with the <em>Swiss Malady</em> and longed to see my Native Country once more.”<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>  After three years in Naples, Jones had had enough of his Italian experience and wanted to go home. He had failed to get enough commissions or find a powerful enough patron, British or Italian.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> Only a few weeks later, in early April 1783, did <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2219\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Hamilton</a> and his family by Francesco Renaldi (1755-c.1790) (1730-1803, travel years 1764-1800) the British emissary and chief “fixer” in Naples, finally agree to buy a large prospective view of the Campi Phlegrei (now lost) which Jones had almost finished.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> It was “too little, too late,” as Jones was determined to return to Britain with his family—his wife, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Maria Moncke</a>, a Danish woman who had been his housekeeper in Rome, and their two daughters (<a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715.2\" target=\"\\_blank\">Anna Maria</a>, b. 1780, travel years 1780-1783; and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715.3\" target=\"\\_blank\">Elizabeth Francesca</a>, b. 1781, travel years 1781-1783)—and they left for Britain a few months later in August 1783.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> The portrait of Jones’ family by Renaldi, painted after their return to Wales, shows the settled appearance of a prosperous Welsh landowner, belying Jones’ seven-year residency in Italy. Jones balances a palette, paintbrush, and painter’s mahlstick on one arm; there is a folder of prints in front of him and an unfinished landscape on an easel behind him. He looks away from his wife and daughters who are portrayed as models of provincial propriety and accomplishment (a self-portrait of Renaldi peers over the scene from the center of the canvas). Jones never returned to Italy; by the time of this portrait, his professional career as a painter was finished and he would devote the final years of his life to running his family’s estate, writing in 1798 that his life had become “with little interruptions, one uniform scene of domestick Retirement—at times, indeed, amusing myself with my beloved Art”, painting for his own amusement.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>For three years, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a> had lived at the center of one of the cultural capitals of Europe—attending the opera, taking day trips to Sorrento by boat, befriending Italian painters, and buying fresh peas from street vendors. His Neapolitan life can be found in the many sources that he left behind—his paintings of the city, his “Memoirs” cited above (based on a diary that he kept at the time at his side, now lost) and a full set of household accounts.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> None of this material is new; art historians, in particular, have used the “Memoirs” and accounts in their analysis of his paintings but few have analyzed these sources, both written and painted, together, as careful and evocative observations of urban life. His visual representations of Naples as a city, especially its buildings and urban spaces, are unique for this period and also for what looks like their abstraction and the absence of any people. Jones’ paintings of the city’s rooftops and spaces conform neither to the contemporary taste for ethnographic representations of Neapolitan street culture, made popular by painters such as Pietro Fabris, nor for the panoramic views of the city by his friend Giovanni Battista Lusieri.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> All of Jones’ Neapolitan cityscapes were painted on paper, suggesting that, like his diary entries, they were his private visual musings and not meant for sale or display to Grand Tourists.</p>\n\n<p>These textual and visual sources evoke urban experience on the Grand Tour—the sounds of streets, the surfaces of buildings, the light hitting canvas awnings. This attention to (sensory) detail in relation to the urban experience of visitors to Italian cities is not easily replicated in the entries of Ingamells’ <em>Dictionary</em>, or in their digital transformation in the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em>. Using the “free-search” function in the <em>Explorer</em> for words relating to the sensory and spatial experience of urban life—such as “smoke,” “noise,” “crowd,” “carriage,” “cart,” “stall,” or “porter”—leads to just a few faint traces. For example, bells appear in an anecdote about <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/587\" target=\"\\_blank\">Frederick Augustus Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol</a>’s (1730-1803, travel years 1765-1766, 1770-1772, 1777-1779, 1785-1786, 1789-1790, 1794-1803), aversion to them as a religious procession passed by his hotel in Siena, which the <em>Dictionary</em>, and hence the <em>Explorer</em>, record from an early nineteenth-century memoir.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup>  While Jones’ account of the “Chaos of Noises filth and Confusion” around his first apartment in Naples is cited from the “Memoirs,” in the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entry and the <em>Explorer</em>, the reasons for the chaos or his concern about putting off prospective clients are not.<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a>’ tour and, in particular, his residence in Naples, as a starting point, this essay seeks to illuminate cases in which the British experience of Italian cities was sustained and engaged, when tourists engaged more deeply with their Italian counterparts and when their stays stretched longer—for some, in fact, becoming life-long. Close consideration of Jones’ paintings and accounts provides clues to guide a “distant reading” through the <em>Explorer</em>. Could the digital transformation operated by the <em>Explorer</em> allow us to glean more of the Italian presence from the <em>Dictionary</em>’s pages? Seeking to grasp the elusive sensory experience of eighteenth-century travelers, could the interpersonal and the temporal dimensions of travel which the <em>Explorer</em> offers help us better color our vision of the British Grand Tour?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Representing Naples in the paintings and words of Thomas Jones</strong></p>\n\n<p>On his visit to Naples, the German painter Jacob Philipp Hackert complimented <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a>, recognizing their affinity as painters who paid “due attention to the <em>Detail</em>—that is to say, minute finishing.”<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> It was this exactness of detail which led to the rediscovery of Jones’ work in the mid-20th century; but it was also this exactness which comes through in his “Memoirs,” as he evokes the sounds and smells of the streets of Italian cities in words. His eye and ear for these details are apparent from the beginning of his tour to Italy, as he passes through different cities, making observations along the way, perhaps distinguishing himself from other Grand Tourists who pay no heed to what happens outside of their carriages. For instance, a walk early in the morning brings an observation about the different ways that porters carry their goods in Turin and Milan. Jones then continues, “It being cold foggy weather, all the men were muffled up to their noses in cloaks, or loose great Coats, with the Sleeves hanging down according to the Italian custom, and Smoking out of curved wooden pipes, the bowls of which only appeared.”<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup> This level of evocative detail extends to descriptions of other environments in which the senses dominate. In Rome, his breath “stop’d” as he entered a room full of smoking Scandinavians and Slavs in Rome,<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> and, in the heat of late September, he recalls, “I was kept in a gentle perspiration, sitting in my Shirt &amp; thin linnen Drawers without Stockens - with the Windows open - and in this dress I sat down to paint.”<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> He recounts a night at the opera in Naples with <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3908\" target=\"\\_blank\">Giuseppe Plura</a> (b. 1753, travel years 1778-1881), which he had to abandon “as the noise was so great that we could not hear the Performers, and the dazzling Glare of the Candles &amp; looking-glasses made me quite giddy.”<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup> His descriptions are not so much an indication of his eye and ear for ethnographic detail but instead show his sensitivity to the senses, of light, sound, and smell.</p>\n\n<p>His paintings of the city are the visual equivalent of these sensory descriptions—the light hitting the pitted surface of walls, the dark cavities of building interiors. These descriptions and paintings establish <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a> as an evocative witness to urban life.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-3.png\" id=\"fig3\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap3\">\n\n<b>Fig. 3:</b> Thomas Jones, <i>Buildings in Naples</i>, 1782.

Like many Grand Tourists, he literally carried ideas about Italians in his jacket pocket as he travelled, but these guidebooks were soon put to the test by his actual interactions with people. Not long after arriving in Rome, he seemed genuinely surprised not to be knifed after a night of conversation with “three sprightly girls,” the daughters of an innkeeper near Frascati. He wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>We were joined by a Couple of young Fellows muffled up to the nose in their long cloaks - I had been so prepossessed, by books, with frightful ideas of Italian jealousy and Italian revenge, that I sat in Agony for the Consequence, nor could my Companions reasoning or ridicule entirely divert me of it - However we at length cheerfully sat down to supper - and soon after went to bed and slept soundly, devoid of Care.<span><sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>By 1779, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a> knew Italian well enough to write love-letters for his friend, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3749\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Pars</a> (1742-1782, travel years 1775-1782), with pleasing results; “the favourable reception and the kind answers” that Pars received to these “Amorous Epistles” was testimony to Jones’ skill in written Italian.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup> From Naples in 1782, Jones remarked that he had not seen an English newspaper since leaving Rome two years earlier.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup> His immersion is also witnessed in the account book in which he recorded his expenses in Naples, shifting suddenly from English to Italian on the day after he slept in his apartment in front of the Dogana del Sale (depicted in <a href=\"#figure-3\">Figure 3</a>), just days after arriving in the city.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> The depth of Jones’ immersion in Naples distinguishes him from many British Grand Tourists. As he had promised himself after his first unsuccessful meeting with <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2219\" target=\"\\_blank\">Hamilton</a> in May 1780, he avoided the company of English tourists as much as he could and, instead, kept company with Italians, with whom he claims to have kept up a correspondence years after he left Italy (although none of it survives).<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup> Within months of Renaldi’s arrival in Naples in July 1781, he had introduced Jones to the Italian painters Giuseppe Bonito and Luigi Micheli; in turn, Micheli lived on the same street as Giambattista Lusieri who also became a friend of Jones.<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> Micheli and Lusieri appear respectively as Don Luigi and Don Titta in Jones’ “Memoirs”. (Lusieri also appears in four other entries in the <em>Explorer</em> by this nickname, transcribed variously as Don Titta, Don Teta, and Don Tito).<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup> Jones’ relationship with these Italian artists is part of a larger web of interconnections that extends well beyond the bounds of the <em>Explorer</em> to include, for instance, overlapping circles of friendship and acquaintance with French artists in Naples such as Pierre-Jacques Volaire.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> These are relationships of varying intensities with non-British artists whose works surfaced in British country house collections—relationships which begin to come into view also through the <em>Explorer</em> as visualized in <a href=\"#figure-4\">Figure 4</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-4.png\" id=\"fig4\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap4&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\n<b>Fig. 4:</b> Thomas Jones in relation to the mentioned names in his entry text, as parsed by the <i>Explorer</i>. Names in italics do not have their own entries, suggest a much wider network of non-British relationships. The figure also distinguishes in maroon the relationships that originated or flourished in Naples, indicating the depth of Jones’ involvement in this city’s social life.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>This brief analysis of <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a>’ paintings and “Memoirs” show the extent to which both are witness to his Neapolitan life.  Jones lived in three residences across the city—the first near the Dogana di Sale which kept him close to the clamor of the warehouses and port, the second near Capodimonte which kept him close to his new Italian artist friends, Lusieri and Micheli, and the third, behind Chiaia, which brought him closer to the “court side” of town and represented a final attempt to find the Grand Tourist patrons that he so desired. His evocation of urban life in Naples illustrates how he could escape the rhetorical and visual tropes of British representations of Italy. When he was writing his “Memoirs,” which he finished fifteen years after his return to Britain in 1798, he reflected on his delight, early during his time in Italy, that he was so “familiarized with, &amp; enamoured of Italian forms,” having copied Italian landscapes under the tutelage of <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5165\" target=\"\\_blank\">Richard Wilson</a> in London in the 1760s (1713-1782, travel years 1750-1756/7).<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> However, Jones’ cityscapes show his willingness to look elsewhere for inspiration. In this way, he was able to develop his own unique visual style, which recorded the light, space, and textures which surrounded him in the city of Naples.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a>’ life and work also reveal the value of British artists as historical informants and the ways in which we can find Italian and British experience of Italy in the extraordinary wealth of material which came out of the eighteenth-century Grand Tour. Can the <em>Explorer</em> allow researchers to develop and build more histories of these connections, engagements, and exchanges with Italy and Italians, while engaging with the qualitative analyses of the many (and often familiar) sources produced by the Grand Tour?</p>\n\n<p><strong>(Word-)Searching for Italians</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jones</a> claimed that Romans divided British travelers into three classes: <em>Artisti</em> (“here, as well for Study and Improvement, as emolument by their profession”), <em>Mezzi-Cavalieri</em> (“who lived genteely, independent of any profession, [and] kept a servant”), and the true <em>Cavalieri</em> or <em>Milordi Inglesi</em> (“those who moved in a Circle of Superior Splendour”).<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> Jones himself was uncertain about his own place within these first two categories and his life story justifies that ambivalence.<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> What is not included in his characterization is a fourth cross-over class of British residents who lived and worked in Italian cities—diplomats, merchants, and men who served the Grand Tour industry or those who might have come to Italy as artists or gentlemen but then set up a household in Italy, becoming longer-term residents. <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2219\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Hamilton</a>, the British emissary to Naples, is perhaps the best known of longer term residents, living in the city more or less continuously, with some brief breaks in England and other parts of Italy between 1764 and 1800; his enduring presence and power in the city and at the Bourbon court makes him a particularly important node from which to study the British community in Naples, and in particular Grand Tourists. There were also British merchants with long-standing relationships to the city for which further archival research in the Italian archives would be necessary in order to go beyond the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> (curiously, there is <em>another</em> <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2218\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Hamilton</a> (travel years 1753-1757), “the oldest and most Eminent Merchant” in the city of Naples, who appears twice in the records, once in 1753 and again in 1757).<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup> The British <em>ciceroni</em> who served the tourist industry were important intermediaries between the British community and Italians and, by necessity, had specific knowledge of Italian cities to offer to their clients, as Carole Paul’s essay on <em>ciceroni</em> demonstrates. These distinctions between Grand Tourists and longer-term residents necessarily reveal that cities could be lived in as more than simply places of amusement, education, or exploitation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a>’ “Memoirs” indicate a variety of important relationships formed not just with other long-term British residents, but also with Italians. During his professional travails, he wrote, desolately, “Looking upon my self as deserted by my Countrymen—the depression of my Spirits was such, that I endeavored avoiding as much as possible those places where I was most likely to meet them.”<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup>  As noted above, Jones was determined to make friends with some local Italian artists, friendships which endured beyond his return to Wales three years later. Yet these Italian men—and Italian women, as Catherine Sama’s essay on Rosalba Carriera shows—are largely absent from Grand Tour scholarship as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>As its title indicates, the <em>Dictionary</em> did not include in its entries the constellation of Italians involved in the Grand Tour. There are, however, brief biographical notes at the back of Ingamells’ book dedicated to “select foreign artists, antiquaries, and diplomats…whose names recur in the <em>Dictionary</em>.” Two-thirds of these supplementary characters are identified as Italian (41 out of a total of 62); of these, the majority are artists long dead before the eighteenth century, which highlights the antiquarian and artistic interests of the Grand Tour as filtered through the hands of Brinsley Ford and Ingamells.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> The <em>Dictionary</em> takes an idiosyncratic approach to a number of Anglo-Italians: it grants no entries, for example, to Marchi or Renaldi, who had painted <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jones</a> and his family before and after his time in Italy, nor do these two artists appear in the supplementary biographies at the back of Ingamells. In contrast, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3908\" target=\"\\_blank\">Giuseppe (or Joseph) Plura</a> (b. 1753, travel years 1778-1881), the son of a Turinese sculptor who had settled in Bath, and a traveling companion for Jones on his first trip to Naples, is included among the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entries.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> This difficulty of “fixing” as either British or Italian the hybrid nature of family lives and career trajectories which crossed Britain and Italy is clear, for example, in the case of the musical performers <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4569\" target=\"\\_blank\">Anna Storace</a> (1766-1817, travel years 1778-1784, c. 1787-c. 1801), and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4570\" target=\"\\_blank\">Stephen Storace</a> (1763-1796, travel years c. 1775-1781), both of whom were born and died in Britain but whose professional life was only recorded by Grand Tourists when they were in Italy.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Dictionary</em>’s pages are peppered with mentions of Italian names and an advantage of the digital <em>Explorer</em> is that it allows us to find many of these Italians who did not merit individual recognition in the original print text. Using the “free-search” function, one can produce a number of matching entries for a more comprehensive review “by hand,” and the <em>Explorer</em>’s mentioned names permit a more systematic search for Italian presence as well. <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a> provides a good example: the graph visualizing the names mentioned in his entry is comprised a third of individuals, mostly Italians and other foreigners, who do not have entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>, drawing in a wider field of names and connections to our study of Jones’ life in Italy (<a href=\"#figure-4\">Figure 4</a>).</p>\n\n<p>However, many Italians appearing in the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entries are artists, and their mention only relates to specific works of architecture or art which Grand Tourists had seen or were buying (“Palladio,” “Guercino,” “Battoni”). Ingamells’ <em>Dictionary</em> must have been an important starting point for Ilaria Bignamini and Clare Hornsby’s reconstruction of the antiquities market in 18th-century Rome in which there were many Italians engaged daily with British agents such as <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2207\" target=\"\\_blank\">Gavin Hamilton</a> (1723-1798, travel years 1748-1750, 1756-1798), <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2680\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jenkins</a> (1722-1798, travel years 1751-1798), and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1652\" target=\"\\_blank\">Robert Fagan</a> (1761-1816, travel years 1781-1782, 1784-1814, c. 1815-1816), but who remain to be studied.<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> Many other entries make mention of British painters and architects both known, such as Carlo Fontana, and unknown, such as “Signor Abramo Paris,” teachers of the Scottish architect <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1937\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Gibb</a> (1682-1754, travel years -1703-1708).</p>\n\n<p>In fact, if one searches for “Signor” in the entries, a number of Italians do come up (along with some British travelers such as <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2283\" target=\"\\_blank\">Johanna Hart</a> (travel years -1756-1757), who appears as  “Signora Giovanna Harz” in the citation of a primary source).<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup> In many cases, these Italians are difficult or impossible to trace without further archival research. For example, “Signor Giacomo” was paid for some architectural plans and for teaching <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1032\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Coke of Holkham</a> (1697-1759, travel years 1713-1717). Less well-known artists, copyists and modelers who served the Grand Tour community also turn up in a search under “Signor”: for example, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1179\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Craster</a> (1735-1772, travel years 1761-1762), an army officer from Craster, Northumbria, commissioned two portraits by Batoni and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1288\" target=\"\\_blank\">Nathaniel Dance</a> (1735-1811, travel years 1754-1766), but he also commissioned “copies in miniature by signora Tibaldi.”<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> Agents such as those in Rome also met the collecting needs of British tourists in other Italian cities, such as Signor Magnolfi, the Florentine agent for the antiquary <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4678\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Talman</a> (1677-1726, travel years 1699-1702, 1709-1717, 1719, 1721, 1723). More <em>signori</em> appear as part of the Grand Tour “service” community including guides and companions such as “Signor Armano of Bologna” who accompanied <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2445\" target=\"\\_blank\">Richard Colte Hoare</a> (1758-1838, travel years 1785-1787, 1788-1791), for the voyage from Tuscany to Rome or Signora Minerbetti, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3169\" target=\"\\_blank\">Horace Mann</a>’s <em>cicisbea</em>, who presented <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1508.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lady Mary Tufton</a> (1723-1806, travel years 1773-1778)—the wife of the Scottish aristocrat <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1508\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Duncan</a> (c. 1715-1774, travel years 1773-1774)—to the Grand Duke of Florence.<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Encounters with Italian <em>signori</em>, however, do not always imply some sort of transcultural understanding or exchange with British travelers. We know that guidebooks framed the responses of British travelers to Italian life, carrying with them characterizations of Italy inherited from anti-Catholic rhetoric developed since the Reformation (and compounded by ancient climatic theories revived by Montesquieu and others in the eighteenth century).<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup> We also know that the British traveling community often stuck together, socializing and traveling in groups and using the same service networks. As <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3319\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Mildmay</a> (c. 1705-1771, travel years 1730-1) suggests in his description upon arriving in Livorno in 1730, many British travelers and residents lived in close-knit English-speaking communities; he writes that “there are computed to be about 43 English families at present &amp; our language is as frequently heard in the streets &amp; coffee houses, as the Italian itself.” These communities were well-served: <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3793\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Pelham</a> (1756-1826, travel years 1777, 1792-1793), for instance, was thrilled to have found in Florence a Signor Molini who “will sell me all kind of English things … from Birmingham,” and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2759\" target=\"\\_blank\">David Ker</a> (1742-1811, travel years 1792-1794), an Irishman, boasted that he had made “an Italian servant we had at Florence [into] a very good English Cook.” Food was a particular concern for Grand Tourists, many of them overcome by a longing for roast beef and disdain for French sauces as soon as they left the shores of England.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup> Italian food seems to have fared better in diaries and travel accounts, although Grand Tourists were always looking for a good roast. After three months in Italy, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a> notes that he and his companion “were both heartily sick of the Italian Soups &amp; Stews…and were obliged to be our own cooks”; his friends were “very glad to sit down to a piece of Roast Beef and Plumb pudding.”<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup> Later, in his memoirs, however, we can see Jones adapting to a new culinary regime. In the final months of his stay in Italy, Jones recorded a visit to “a large Manufactory of Maccaroni” on the outskirts of Naples, near Torre Annunziata (where the manufacturing of <em>pastasciutta</em> continues today), and he bought twenty-four pounds of macaroni as part of his food supplies for his family’s trip home to England by sea in August 1783.<sup id=\"fnref:40\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup> While Grand Tourists were more often longing for English food while away from home, this taste for Italian food in England was not unusual; a number of them wanted to recreate these new tastes and flavors, shipping home Chianti wine and Parmesan cheese, and, after their return, buying more Italian food from fashionable grocers in London.<sup id=\"fnref:41\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></sup> Jones’ reliance on such a large amount of macaroni as a foodstuff for his trip home to England confirms the depth of his and his family’s alimentary acculturation during his long residency in the city.<sup id=\"fnref:42\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Travel to Italy, at least dating from the Renaissance, was meant to be educational, and in the eighteenth century, the Grand Tour had not yet lost its didactic function. Travelers not only acquired wheels of Parmesan cheese and antique Roman objects to ship back to Britain but many were also keen to gain some knowledge of the modern Italian language.<sup id=\"fnref:43\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></sup> Grammar books were produced specifically for this purpose,<sup id=\"fnref:44\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></sup> and a number of <em>signori</em> in the <em>Explorer</em> provided instruction in Italian. When the antiquarian <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4040\" target=\"\\_blank\">Richard Rawlinson</a> (1690-1755, travel years 1720-1726) returned to Rome in the autumn of 1721, he “learned that his language master had died but within four days he had [found] another, ‘Signore de la Mothe’.” In Rome, in the summer of 1777, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3793\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Pelham</a> spent his mornings “employed in learning Italian &amp; the History of Italy” and when he was in Florence in the autumn, he hired his father’s former Italian language teacher, the Abbé Pellori. There were, of course, Italians who could speak English and entertain and keep the British travelers company. <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jones</a> noted with pleasure that, after a day’s sight-seeing during a short stay in Bologna, on his way down to Rome he had “met Dr Geraldi who spoke good English at the Cof-House.”<sup id=\"fnref:45\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></sup> One British resident in Florence wrote that since <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5044\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Weddell</a> (1736-1792, travel years 1764-1765) and his companion spoke no Italian or French and “the Society of the Inhabitants here did not give them much pleasure, they chose to spend their evenings with ‘Signor Cassali’.”<sup id=\"fnref:46\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>As these examples suggest, British travelers did indeed form relationships with Italian <em>signori</em>. Some of them were strictly financial, as this short but enigmatic entry for <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2980\" target=\"\\_blank\">Isabella Littlejohn</a> (travel year 1790) suggests: “<a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Byres</a> borrowed money from Isabella Littlejohn (Signora Francesco Tribuzzi) in 1790.” For many travelers, their primary and daily contact with Italians was as their tenants or guests, such as the portrait painter <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2728\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Keeble</a> (or Keable) (1714-1774, travel years 1761-1774) who “lived in the house of Domenico Gandolfi” when he was in Bologna. There were also professional relationships. The Irish painter <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/265\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Barry</a> (1741-1806, travel years 1766-1771) attributed his election to the Accademia Clementina “to the obliging dispositions of two friends of mine here, Mr Keable and Signor Bianconi.” Castruccio Bonamici commissioned the same Keeble to paint his portrait in Naples.<sup id=\"fnref:47\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></sup> Some of these financial arrangements also betray sentimental relationships—such as the annuity left in the will of <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/521\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Bouverie</a> (c. 1722-1750, travel years 1741-1742, 1745-1746, 1749-1750) to “Signora Teresa Tacconio of Bologna.” As Jeremy Black has reiterated, the Grand Tour also provided opportunities for sexual experimentation and social transgression for British travelers away from home.<sup id=\"fnref:48\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:48\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></sup> For example, the Third Earl of Peterborough, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3832\" target=\"\\_blank\">Charles Mordaunt</a> (1658-1735, travel years 1706-1707, 1711-1712, 1714, 1715, 1716-1718, 1719-1720) was known to stay in Bologna, “where he has been many times,” for private reasons “regarding his engagement to Signora Catina.” Many of these characters—from Signor Giacomo to Signora Catina—remain unknown and the unevenness of Ingamells’ use of biographical data in the <em>Dictionary</em> means that these sorts of relationships are sometimes difficult to quantify across the <em>Explorer</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to gauge British engagement with Italian society would be to examine the number of “travelers” who married Italians. In most cases, this implies a reconsideration of terms such as Grand Tourists and travelers (which Ingamells implicitly did by including British residents in his <em>Dictionary</em>). Further archival research in cities such as Livorno where there had been a continuous presence of British merchants since the early modern period would be one way forward, as Simon Macdonald’s new research on the British resident community in Paris has so fruitfully shown.<sup id=\"fnref:49\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:49\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></sup> More research could also be done on the importance of the resident British community which serviced travelers’ needs, their local knowledge commodified for this shifting group of Grand Tourists. In the <em>Explorer</em>, the information regarding marriage is found in the main headings of each entry, although there is not yet a separate category to search this information across entries (while one can of course do such a search within the downloaded dataset). A casual search found two Irish Catholics married to Italian women—the dealer <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1652\" target=\"\\_blank\">Robert Fagan</a>, who lived in Italy for thirty years and was married twice to young Italian women, and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2759\" target=\"\\_blank\">David Ker</a> (1742-1811, travel years 1792-1794), who spent two years in Italy with his three daughters after the death of his Venetian wife, Maddalena Guardi, in 1785.<sup id=\"fnref:50\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:50\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></sup> There is also the case of <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/135\" target=\"\\_blank\">Eliza Ashburner</a> (travel years 1783-1800-), “a lady-in-waiting to one of the daughters of the Queen of Naples” who had married Signor Perconte (a <em>secretario refferendario del Regno</em>) in June 1800, presumably in the aftermath of the rushed retreat of the Bourbon court to Naples. A more focused word-search using Italian first-names found a number of Britons married to Italians—for example, the search for a common first-name, “Giovanna,” found <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2636\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Jackson</a> (1692-1763, travel years c. 1713-1763), described as a diplomat and merchant by Ingamells. Married to an Italian Catholic, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2636.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Mary Joanna Rimaldini</a>, Jackson lived most of his life in Livorno, fifty years in total, except for a two-year stint as the British consul in Genoa, and he died in Ancona, presumably while visiting <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2636.5\" target=\"\\_blank\">his daughter</a>.<sup id=\"fnref:51\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:51\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">50</a></sup>  Testimony to his rootedness in Italian society is that the Cardinal from which he received special dispensation to marry as a Protestant became Pope Benedict XIV and was the godfather of Jackson’s eldest son, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2636.2\" target=\"\\_blank\">Prospero</a>. George Jackson’s knowledge of Italian culture clearly went beyond polite conversation; Jackson gathered an enormous library of more than 3000 books and manuscripts in Italian and Latin for which he published a catalog in 1756.<sup id=\"fnref:52\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></sup> Jackson was buried in the English cemetery in Livorno and his tombstone still carries the spelling mistakes in English of the Italian stone mason who carved it.<sup id=\"fnref:53\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:53\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></sup> A search for the male equivalent, “Giovanni,” brings up the husband of <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2677\" target=\"\\_blank\">Anna Maria Jenkins</a> (travel years 1788-1794-) who spent four years in Rome with her uncle, the antiquary <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2680\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jenkins</a>;<sup id=\"fnref:54\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:54\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></sup> Anna Maria married Giovanni Martinez, “the nephew of Thomas Jenkins’s neighbor on the Corso,” in 1794 but there is no further notice of her life in Italy or in England. Marriage to an Italian, of course, is not the only way to gauge the rootedness of British residents in Italy. The unmarried British Abbés and Monsignors who pop up throughout the <em>Dictionary</em> bely the significant number of British Catholics (including Stuart sympathizers) who made Rome their home over many years. Nonetheless, this directed and random word-searching has brought to light a number of Italians whose relationship with Britons went beyond buying art or social visits in aristocratic palaces. In turn, further research would need to be done to know more about British travelers who became residents, sometimes working for British Grand Tourists, occasionally marrying Italians, living out their lives in Italy, and sometimes dying there as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visualizing British experience in Italy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Might the rich travel data contained in the <em>Explorer</em> offer insights or ways to approach the question of British engagement with Italian urban life? In many ways, the <em>Explorer</em> confirms the well-worn narrative, with the largest number of travelers going to Rome (3384), followed by Florence (2154), Venice (2138), and Naples (1942). It is common knowledge that travel itineraries on the Grand Tour varied, some travelers completing their travels over a few months, others over a few years, most often with the intention of returning home to Britain. We also know that there were seasonal patterns to visits to particular cities—as Rosemary Sweet reminds us, travelers often went to Naples for Lent to get away from the boredom of Rome or, for shorter periods, to Venice for Carnival.<sup id=\"fnref:55\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:55\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">54</a></sup>  Grand Tour itineraries followed these seasonal ebbs and flows—for instance, the liquefaction of San Gennaro’s blood each year on 22 September was a must-see for many tourists, including <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a> who managed to combine his first visit to Naples in September 1778 to time with the feast day of the city’s patron saint and an eruption of Vesuvius.<sup id=\"fnref:56\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:56\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">55</a></sup> The regular eruptions of Vesuvius in the eighteenth century brought visitors to Naples within days, as Goethe notes in his entry from 24 November 1787: “At the moment it seems as if all the art treasures of Rome were of no account; all the foreigners have interrupted their sightseeing tour and are hurrying off to Naples.”<sup id=\"fnref:57\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:57\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">56</a></sup> Further research could track the known eruptions of Vesuvius with the arrival dates of tourists using the <em>Explorer</em> as well as map the seasonal patterns of visitors to the city according to religious festivals—for example, Lent to Easter—or to the weather—for example, avoiding the intensity of the heat of the summer or enjoying the mild weather in the winter months in Naples.</p>\n\n<p>Yet popularity of “travel places” alone is only one possible approach, and complicated by the absences in the archive. First, there is the matter of the often absent details of the journey to and within Italy. We have to assume that most Grand Tourists in the database started their travels in Britain, arriving by land or sea from France, from further east by land, or sailing around Gibraltar. “Gateway” cities, searched as “travel places” in the <em>Explorer</em>, included Turin (949), Milan (590) and Bologna (671) on the way to Rome from France, or Leghorn (977, although 3 for Livorno) if arriving by sea to Florence, or smaller stops such as Terracina (13) on the way to Naples. While tourists must have stopped through many of these cities <em>en route</em>, they appear much less popular than the major destination cities (as “travel places”): this, of course, has to do with the fact that Grand Tourists did not always record their stays in their diaries and memoirs, or that they were not included by Ingamells and his collaborators, even though we know of the existence of inns which served these popular routes.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> allows us to take a different approach to the qualities of stays in cities, and, in turn, engagement with Italian life. Even within the biography of one traveler, there is variety in the length as well as the quality of visits. <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jones</a> first stayed in Naples for just four months in 1778 but then he returned two years later and stayed for three years until 1783. The first visit in his memoirs records a typical Grand Tour itinerary with trips to the main sites in and around the city while his second is taken up by more mundane business of finding accommodation, moving furniture, and buying paints.<sup id=\"fnref:58\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:58\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">57</a></sup> Continuing to use Jones as our guide, we can look for “travelers” who stayed longer in any city and who might have engaged more substantially with Italian urban life.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that the absences in the archive continue to shape the possibilities and results of such an exploration. Data often remains incomplete for travelers who did not keep diaries as detailed as Jones’, or whose best records remain in Italian archives, unincorporated in the <em>Dictionary</em>. Some indicate approximate dates of stay or just a year, while others give exact dates of stays—compare, for instance, Jones’ “travels” with his friend <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Pars</a>’ in the <em>Explorer</em>, whose dates were partially reconstructed by using Jones’ “Memoirs”. All in all, about a quarter of travelers are recorded with enough detail to calculate their duration of stay (1450 of 6,007).<sup id=\"fnref:59\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:59\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">58</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-5.svg\" id=\"fig5\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap5&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap5\">\n\n<b>Fig. 5:</b> Number of trips to popular cities.

While Naples had only the fourth largest number of visitors, the average length of stay in the city (43 days) was nearly as long as that in Rome (50.5) and far longer than all other popular cities.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"#figure-7\">Figure 7</a> shows the division of travelers by occupation, but indicates the difficulty of data absence in many categories. While diplomats, merchants, painters, and statesmen represent some of the most numerous groups, there are still significant limitations to the dating of their travels. The long residencies of men such as <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2636\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Jackson</a> as a merchant in Livorno stand out immediately—in fact, only three merchants have precise enough dating to be included within the subset, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/612\" target=\"\\_blank\">N. Brooke</a> (travel years 1786-1797), <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/916\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Chetham</a> (1678-1701, travel years 1700-1701), and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2238\" target=\"\\_blank\">Christopher Hanbury</a> (c. 1661-1716, travel years -1704-1716). We know anecdotally and from current research which focuses on Rome that artists spent extensive periods of time, in some cases, their entire working life in the city.<sup id=\"fnref:60\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:60\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">59</a></sup> But the result for a city like Livorno is harder to read. Nonetheless the length of stay in Naples across these occupation groups indicates the greater depth of British engagement with the urban life in Naples by Grand Tourists.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-7a\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-7a.svg\" id=\"fig7a\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig7b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7c&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7d&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<a name=\"figure-7b\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-7b.svg\" id=\"fig7b\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig7a&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7c&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7d&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<a name=\"figure-7c\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-7c.svg\" id=\"fig7c\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig7a&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7d&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<a name=\"figure-7d\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-7d.svg\" id=\"fig7d\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig7a&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7c&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap7\">\n\n<b>Fig. 7:</b> The median number of days spent in each city by occupation of traveler. From top to bottom: diplomats, merchants, painters, and statesmen. While cases such as the merchants of Leghorn become difficult to compare, we can note the generally lengthy stays in Rome and Naples across occupations.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> allows us to easily compare the death dates of travelers against their time of travel to the city as another potential indicator of a length of stay. While more Britons “saw Rome and died” (64), there were a considerable number of British travelers who can be inferred to have died in Naples (40)—which echoes the expression in Italian, <em>Vedi Napoli e muore</em>. There were more deaths proportionally in Naples than in Florence (22) and Venice (17) where visitors often stayed for less time. In fact, the next largest number of British deaths after those in Rome and Naples are those in Livorno (70), which represents 7.2% of the overall number of travelers to the Tuscan port (977). At first glance, the number of deaths in Livorno appears representative of the resident community of merchants who, like <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2636\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Jackson</a>, lived their adult life there and became old in the city, and of the rich sources about the Leghorn cemeteries available to the <em>Dictionary</em>’s compilers, which is not available for other cities. Alternatively, it might have to do with the fact that British ships stopped in the port on their way to Britain, as it seems was the case for <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2874.3\" target=\"\\_blank\">Edward</a> (c. 1792-1797, travel year 1797) and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2874.2\" target=\"\\_blank\">Richard Lee</a> (c. 1791-1797, travel year 1797), who died at ages six and four years on their way from Smyrna, having lost <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2874.4\" target=\"\\_blank\">their sister</a> (c. 1792-1797, travel year 1797) in Naples on the way.<sup id=\"fnref:61\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:61\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">60</a></sup> We know that many British travelers in poor health went to Naples with the belief that the mild climate of the city would improve their health and we know that some of these “invalids” died there.<sup id=\"fnref:62\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:62\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">61</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>As these final figures demonstrate, British Grand Tourists engaged with Italian society beyond the buying of antiquities and visiting of churches on the shorter visits that were common in most of the cities of the Grand Tour. The evidence from Naples shows the many tourists stayed longer. Not unlike Rome, Naples offered many opportunities for tourists and, to some extent, artists—this might have changed over time as the sites of Herculaneum and Pompeii and their excavated treasures were unique draws to the city by the end of the eighteenth century. The evocative memoirs and paintings of <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jones</a> clearly demonstrate the depth of the British engagement with Italian cityscapes, particularly that of Naples. The <em>Explorer</em> provides several methods for putting that knowledge in a greater context, to better understand whether Thomas Jones’ engagement with the city was as exceptional as it seems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></p>\n\n<p>For their advice or bibliographical help in the writing of this paper, I would like to thank John Gallagher, Simon Macdonald, Renaud Morieux, Katie Scott, Simon Schaffer, and especially Tim Spiers.

Numerous performer-impresarios crossed the Channel to tour throughout Europe and beyond offering spectacles geared around audacious equestrian displays. The vogue reached Italy around 1770, when the description above was written by the astounded Vicenza diarist Arnaldo Arnaldi Tornieri. The showman seen by Tornieri was probably <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5031\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Wear</a> (travel year 1770), whose extensive Italian tour that year is widely documented.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Writing to the city authorities in Rome that summer, Wear introduced himself as a master horseman (<em>cavallerizzo</em>) wishing to show the public his <em>virtù</em> in this genre.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> Wear’s spectacular performances involved musical accompaniments, ambitious staging, and a range of publicity materials.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> At some point during his continental travels he had flyers printed illustrating his daring showmanship (<a href=\"#figure-1\">Figure 1</a>).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\"> <img src=\"macdonald-figure-1.png\" id=\"fig1\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1\">\n\n<b>Fig. 1:</b> Asner, <i>William Wear ecuyer anglois</i>, etching, n. d.

And <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5031\" target=\"\\_blank\">Wear</a> was just one operator in a cutthroat field. Another such troupe was led by <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3976\" target=\"\\_blank\">Peter Price</a> along with his <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3976.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">wife</a> (travel year 1782). When Price and his companions sought permission to perform in Rome, they boasted of previous performances before courtly audiences in Britain, France, Sardinia, Prussia, Poland and Russia. Describing their presence in Rome as part of a voyage which would ultimately take them to Constantinople, they asked for leave “to show in this Mother City the exercises of the <em>Knights of the English School</em>.”<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5031\" target=\"\\_blank\">Wear</a>, <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3976\" target=\"\\_blank\">Price</a> and the several other British <em>cavallerizzi</em> troupes who performed in Italy around this period have not yet received substantive historical study.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> But, as this essay will propose, these Italian journeys are of interest both in their own right and also as a basis for posing larger historical questions. Touring eighteenth-century Italian cities while feting <em>virtù</em> and gallantry tends to be associated with a very different—and much more abundantly studied—type of travel, namely the Grand Tour and its participants, a practice bound up with elite self-fashioning and the performance of socio-cultural distinction.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> For relatively plebeian commercial traveling performers to draw on such elevating language was to posit themselves as <em>virtuoso</em> knights engaged on their own kind of Grand Tour.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>This essay takes the idea of a parallel, juxtaposition or overlap between these very different social categories of traveler as a cue to explore questions about the actual social range of foreign visitors to Italy around this juncture. More specifically, it takes the case of these <em>cavallerizzi</em> as a vantage point for examining the prosopography of over 6,000 British and Irish travelers to Italy during the eighteenth century offered by the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em>. The <em>Explorer</em> allows a novel point of access to the mass of valuable research material presented in <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells (1997). Appraising the social range and representativeness of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s prosopography through the interface of the <em>Explorer</em> necessitates an understanding of the original book’s scope and its underlying sources. Reviewed in this light, the <em>cavallerizzi</em> are discussed here as a case study of the many possibilities—as well as some of the limitations—of prosopographical enquiry into the wider social field of British and Irish travelers to Italy (<a href=\"#figure-2\">Figure 2</a>).</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"figure-2\"></a></p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Entry in <i>Dictionary</i></th>\n      <th>Entry in <i>GTE<i></i></i></th>\n      <th>Sources in <i>Dictionary</i>/<i>GTE<i></i></i></th>\n      <th>Other Sources and Notes</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Wear</td>\n      <td>YES</td>\n      <td><a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5031\" target=\"_blank\">YES</a></td>\n      <td>Verri, <i>Cart</i>. <br /> <i>Gazz.

I then turned to the <em>Explorer</em>—and especially to the word search feature it offers, which greatly facilitates access to the <em>Dictionary</em> text—in order to seek further such cases beyond those I had chanced upon during my initial archival research, before finally exploring further in additional sources. Happily, both <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5031\" target=\"\\_blank\">Wear</a> and <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3976\" target=\"\\_blank\">Price</a> do in fact have biographical entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>.

A trick-rider named <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3947\" target=\"\\_blank\">Potts</a> (travel year 1772) performed in Venice in 1772: his “feats of Horsemanship” were noted by one British tourist, <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1828\" target=\"\\_blank\">Philip Francis</a> (travel year 1772), as the only diversion then available in the city.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> Another such performer, <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2568\" target=\"\\_blank\">Charles Hughes</a> (travel year 1775), is recorded in Florence and Rome a few years later; a poster also survives advertising his performances in Venice (<a href=\"#figure-3\">Figure 3</a>).<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\"> <img src=\"macdonald-figure-3.png\" id=\"fig1\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig3&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap3\">\n\n<b>Fig. 3:</b> <i>E giunto in questa dominante città il celebre signor Hughes, cavallerizzo dell’accademia di suà maestà brittanica, del quale vengono rappresentate vari giuochi di cavallerizza, non mai più veduti, e che sorprenderanno l’universale aspettazzione</i>, wood engraving, n. d., dimensions unknown.

On the other hand, the entries in question comprise only a sentence or two, and, as will be seen below, not every British trick-rider who toured Italy made it into the text. This mixed coverage relates, in part, to the history of the <em>Dictionary</em> itself, of which the animating focus—and greatest strength in practice—is the Grand Tour milieu, rather than a complete prosopography of all British and Irish travelers in eighteenth-century Italy. New research by Giovanna Ceserani has helped establish how the <em>Dictionary</em> was greatly transformed over the long period of its development. As launched by Ford in the decades after the Second World War, the venture was initially envisioned within relatively confined art historical or antiquarian limits, and as a contribution to the history of taste and collecting. Over time, however, the scope of research expanded, and with it the remit of the ultimate publication.</p>\n\n<p>Elements of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s larger intellectual genealogy and context may also be suggested. First, the question of prosopography was, during the period of the project’s gestation, becoming highly topical among historians. This was especially the case in relation to the study of the eighteenth-century British political elite, notably in the wake of the influential work of Sir Lewis Namier.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup> Second, the project developed against the backdrop of what Peter Mandler has termed “sales of <em>virtù</em>,” that is, changes in ownership, over the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, of many of the private papers and collections which had been accrued during the eighteenth-century heyday of the Grand Tour.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> The dispersal of such material traces of the Grand Tour ultimately promoted wide-ranging efforts to record and study the eighteenth-century milieu involved in their initial fabrication, with the <em>Dictionary</em> offering a case in point.</p>\n\n<p>When the editorial decision was taken to produce a work which would no longer be delimited to a study of British artistic or Grand Tour-related engagement with eighteenth-century Italy, but rather an open-ended biographical dictionary attempting to document <em>all</em> travelers from Britain and Ireland to Italy during the period, this shift entailed drawing upon a larger constellation of sources, then tapping them more systematically. In particular, expanding the venture’s ambition in this manner meant that, besides focusing on sources produced by travelers themselves, research for the <em>Dictionary</em> would also involve the dedicated exploration of multiple Italian archival records. Indeed, one of the signal virtues of the published <em>Dictionary</em> is that it encompasses serious study of sources relating to the monitoring, administration, or “policing,” broadly understood, of foreigners in eighteenth-century Italy. Notably, for certain cities such as Venice, relatively thorough bureaucratic records survive describing arrivals and departures by given foreigners. And these kinds of administrative sources—names on lists and registers—form a low-profile but invaluable bedrock for the <em>Dictionary</em>’s prosopography, and help reveal a cast of historical actors far wider than the socio-cultural elite alone.<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In a schematic way, then, the eighteenth-century sources underpinning the <em>Dictionary</em> may be considered under two main headings. First, the book described British and Irish travelers from material largely stemming from their own records, collections and artistic productions. Second, it drew on documentation regarding such travelers and trajectories in Italian bureaucratic or policing archives. If the first set of sources are more qualitative—and indeed furnished much of the completed <em>Dictionary</em>’s word count and anecdotal color—then it might appear natural to consider the second as broadly quantitative. And yet, at least for the question of the social variety of travelers, this would be somewhat misleading. For not every foreigner was accorded even the basic official attention of having their arrival at a given Italian locale noted. In the Venetian registers for example—perhaps the single most extensive source of this kind used in the <em>Dictionary</em>—often only the nominal head, usually male, of a given traveling party is explicitly named; other family members and servants frequently went unlisted, unnamed, or otherwise under-described. More fundamentally, efforts by eighteenth-century bureaucracies to map people in movement were never a perfect dragnet.<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> Lists and registers produced by eighteenth-century Italian administrators represented a partially realized aspiration, and sometimes a deceptive simulacrum, of all-encompassing surveillance and control, rather than a reality of full coverage. The idea of total or encyclopedic coverage is itself a historical artifact, an ambition—or rather an illusion—which fascinated Enlightenment-era administrators, reformers and police. The <em>Dictionary</em>, and indeed the very idea of a “dictionary,” partly reproduces this illusion.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> gives the <em>Dictionary</em>’s sources, showing on which of these, and in what quantity, the entries in the text rely. Some sources on British and Irish travelers in Italy during the eighteenth century eluded the compilers of the <em>Dictionary</em>. That various private papers and other surviving miscellaneous records about individual trajectories were unavailable or missed in the book’s preparation is unsurprising, and does not in itself constitute a profound heuristic handicap. A vast amount of such material would be required to effect a drastic quantitative revision to the <em>Dictionary</em>’s prosopography as published in 1997. Even if this were achieved, it seems implausible that this would produce a dramatically different qualitative picture to the existing Grand Tour-centered one. Far more significant an omission, however, was that the <em>Dictionary</em> overlooked a major set of official records which are of considerable and distinctive prosopographical value, namely the registers of the British Protestant chapel at Livorno.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup> Held at the National Archives in London, the Livorno chapel records have to date received almost no scholarly attention.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> During the ninety-year period between the commencement of the chapel registers in 1707, until the temporary withdrawal of the British factory of merchants from Livorno in the late 1790s, more than 800 burials are listed, around 400 baptisms, and somewhat fewer marriages. On the face of it, these are significant figures to set against the approximately 6,000 traveling individuals that the <em>Explorer</em> has identified in its digital parsing of the entries from the <em>Dictionary</em>. Some of the names in the Livorno registers do already appear in the <em>Dictionary</em>, having been encountered via other sources. And indeed the compilers drew on one proximate source which has partial overlap with the Livorno chapel registers, namely a list of inscriptions in the British cemetery at Livorno—a work which is cited in approximately 130 entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> Others names from the registers would have been irrelevant for the <em>Dictionary</em>’s purposes, since not everyone featuring therein is British or Irish (and this is in fact part of their interest as a source). All told, had the Livorno chapel records been incorporated into the <em>Dictionary</em>, the result might well have been several hundred additional names. While representing a significant boost, this would not have radically transformed the size of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s coverage. This additional material would, however, have principally related to, and helped to further reveal, the mercantile face of British–Irish engagement with eighteenth-century Italy, instead of the more familiar Grand Tour ambit: this focus was presumably one reason why the Livorno registers went unnoticed in the first place. These remarks about the Livorno registers notwithstanding, the <em>Dictionary</em> does nonetheless feature many merchants, and the <em>Explorer</em>’s digital transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em>, allowing the aggregation of travelers that appear as merchants, both grants them more visibility and has been the basis for Reinert’s analysis of this component of the Grand Tour world.</p>\n\n<p>This review of sources animating the <em>Dictionary</em>’s prosopography might end there, were it not that, in the particular case of the <em>cavallerizzi</em>, one extraordinary additional document has recently come to light. This is a manuscript memoir which centers exactly around what its author dubs the “Break-neck Jockeyship” milieu.<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> The author in question, Thomas Hammond, worked as a servant for a trick-rider named James Wolton during an extensive continental tour which included a season spent crossing Italy in 1770. Hammond’s account reveals a host of fascinating specifics about the trick-riders’ multifarious—and skullduggery-filled—business arrangements. Above all it supplies the author’s own remarkable voice, opening a window onto his lived experiences and personal dramas. The production and survival of such a text, at this social level, is highly unusual. Set against the existing prosopography of the <em>Dictionary</em>, Hammond’s memoirs flesh out individuals and a milieu which otherwise would remain largely irrecoverable.</p>\n\n<p>Hammond’s picaresque narrative can only be briefly presented here. He introduces the other members of Wolton’s rackety operation, a young woman named Elizabeth Page—whom Wolton falsely presented as his wife—and “an English Lad call’d Peter, who spoke Italian.”<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> Hammond also describes encounters with competing British <em>cavallerizzi</em>, including a number of the figures noted at the start of this essay. Thus, before crossing the Alps, Wolton’s company met “Mr. <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3976\" target=\"\\_blank\">Price</a> the famous rider.” He sought to discourage them from touring Italy, declaring “that it would not answer for we should only spend our Money and get Nothing.” But it subsequently transpired that Price’s comments about Italy “were lies that he forged to detain us from going there where he had never been, but where he intended to go.” The two parties crossed paths again in Turin, pragmatically agreeing to take different Italian itineraries so that “we may not be a hindrance to each other.”<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup> A subsequent encounter with another equestrian performer, our own <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5031\" target=\"\\_blank\">Wear</a>, occurred just as Wolton was finalizing arrangements to perform in Venice. Such cases of crossing ways while abroad were also characteristic of the travels of more typical Grand Tourists, but this meeting occasioned a distinct outcome. Rather than seek to out-compete one another, Wolton and Wear entered into an uneasy provisional partnership. Hammond vividly described the spectacle as the audience arrived for their opening performance at “this water-built city,” held at a former riding school on the Giudecca:</p>\n\n<blockquote>… the great channel from St. Mark’s Square was Covered with Gondoloes full of Gentlemen &amp; Ladies all Mask’d, who being seated in the Ride, look’d like so Many specters, for their Masks were all white; and their coming over in those black Gondoloes looked as if they had been a troop of Ghosts that Mercury had conducted to the borders of the River Styx to be wafted over by the inexorable Charon into the Elysian fields, or Mansions of the Dead. However&#8212;Ugly as they were they brought us money, and we performed there twelve times[.]<span><sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>All of Wolton’s group, Hammond included, are conspicuously absent in the <em>Dictionary</em>. To this extent, Hammond’s memoirs attest to the imperfection of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s coverage, as discussed above.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> Yet they also substantiate its broader heuristic value, since the <em>Dictionary</em> in many ways helps make sense of an account such as Hammond’s, especially if it is digitally searchable as in the <em>Explorer</em>. Seen in this light, the <em>Explorer</em> can best be treated as an opportunity—as an invitation to take advantage of what this material does show us—rather than lamented for incompleteness where “completeness” was never possible. The <em>Dictionary</em> as it stands, and therefore the <em>Explorer</em>, represents a far-reaching compilation of surviving sources, including of the relevant Italian archival material. Notwithstanding its elite focus, the <em>Dictionary</em> also contains many sidelights on “lesser” travelers. While inviting reflections about the social range of travelers, the <em>Dictionary</em> also helps to elucidate the extent to which different social groups related to—or stood apart from—one another.</p>\n\n<p>Looking beyond the trick-riders, it is possible to discover at least glimpses of other more workaday or plebeian lives in the <em>Dictionary</em>, which is made easier by scrolling through “Employments and Identifiers” in the <em>Explorer</em>. In most cases, non-elite individuals appear therein because of client relationships with elite patrons, notably through work in service. One striking example from the world of court patronage is <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2721\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Joy</a> (1675-1734, travel years c.1702-33), who was “Strong Man to the Great Duke of Tuscany” over the early decades of the century. Many such individuals feature only fortuitously, often accorded brief entries because of some quixotic incident: <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3578\" target=\"\\_blank\">Richard Noakes</a>, a clockmaker, recorded in Rome in 1757 as having absconded with valuables entrusted to his care; <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/719\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Burton</a> (1730-1782, travel years 1775-1776 and 1782), a harpsichordist who died of fever in Naples in 1782, while in the employment of <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/334\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Beckford of Fonthill</a> (1759-1844, travel years 1780-81, 1782 and 1792); and <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/753\" target=\"\\_blank\">Mrs. Mary Cadogan</a> (d. 1810, travel years 1786-1800), the daughter of a Welsh shepherd, and more famous for being the mother of <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2205\" target=\"\\_blank\">Emma Hamilton</a> (1765-1815, travel years 1786-1800). Like the trick-riders, in many ways it is impressive that such figures appear at all in the <em>Dictionary</em>, yet all the aforementioned are simultaneously absent in the sense that their entries are relatively sparse or vacant.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> Furthermore, the <em>Dictionary</em>’s construction tends to obscure numerous other non-elite individuals. For example, it frequently clusters references to whole traveling parties in a single entry for one dominant individual, thereby reproducing eighteenth-century social hierarchies. It is notable as well that the <em>Dictionary</em> has no entries under the name “Anonymous.” One advantage of the <em>Explorer</em> is to render more visible all manner of individuals—named and unnamed—either with the creation of new entries when the digital parsing has identified these travelers, or by searching the text for given keywords, such as “servant” or “maid.” Other keyword search results, however, are more salutary in obliging us to recall quite what a pale reflection the <em>Dictionary</em> can provide of the true proportions of non-elite travel. Thus, only one sailor, a certain <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1892\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Gardener</a> (travel year 1747), appears to have received a dedicated entry: yet presumably the number of British and Irish mariners to have made port in Italy over the course of the century would have easily exceeded the total number of entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Equally, while the discussion here has focused on the challenges of exploring the social range of British and Irish travelers to eighteenth-century Italy through the <em>Dictionary</em>, many of the same considerations apply for additional, and sometimes overlapping, occluded groups and categories. At all social levels, women seem to be underrepresented in the <em>Dictionary</em> by comparison to their male fellow travelers. The <em>Explorer</em>’s digital transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em> has sought to correct this underrepresentation, at least by creating new entries for travelers (largely women) previously subsumed in others’ entries, as in the case of <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3976.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Price’s wife</a>. Sweet’s essay in the present collection has used this new data for innovative analysis, while certainly it remains true that more women traveled than we can ever recover by what the surviving sources record. Searching the <em>Explorer</em> for keywords relating to British colonial worlds produces far more references to individuals enriched by the spoils of empire than to subaltern lives, albeit that there are a handful of exceptions to this. For example, the entry for an “English Catholic from Barbados” named <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/62\" target=\"\\_blank\">Allen</a> (travel years 1728-30) states that “one of his black slaves became a Christian” in Rome in 1729; the <em>Explorer</em> created a new entry for this <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/62.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">slave</a>, but the question persists of how many others remain unmentioned and forgotten.[^33] Furthermore, as the example of the <em>cavallerizzi</em> suggests, the <em>Explorer</em> can be used to trace terms relating to non-human actors and travelers, notably horses but also other animals. For instance, one contemporary account describes <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1760\" target=\"\\_blank\">Martin Folkes</a> (1690-1754, travel years 1733-35) going to Rome in 1733 “with his wife and daughters, dog, cat, parrot and monkey.”<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>This essay began by highlighting how elements of the trick-riders’ self-presentation echoed the Grand Tour model. Evaluating this parallel illumines the equivocal profile that the <em>cavallerizzi</em> came to receive in the historical record—and in the <em>Dictionary</em>—but also points to what made them prosopographically distinctive. Much of their interest, indeed, relates to how they upend traditional Grand Tour frameworks. They came to Italy not to spend money, consume culture, or acquire <em>virtù</em>—nor were they part of the baggage train of Grand Tourism and its associated trades, arts and services. Rather, they were already <em>virtuosi</em> in their field, and were in Italy to make instant money from their own ephemeral productions: their displays were voguish lowbrow entertainment rather than higher-brow fare indebted to classical or artistic canons. This British engagement with Italy was more a matter of export than of import, and more an epiphenomenon of eighteenth-century “Anglomania”—in this case centered around horse husbandry and sporting spectacle—than of fascination with Italy’s cultural capital.<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> Indeed, some of the trick-riders scarcely wished to be there, and were touring abroad simply as a contingency after having been shouldered out of the hyper-competitive “Harlequin Horsemanship” market in Britain itself.<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, one reason we are able to reconstruct these trajectories in any detail is precisely because they also had notable points of proximity and even overlap with the Grand Tour. Newspaper reports advertising <em>cavallerizzi</em> performances shared column space with reports of foreign grandees’ comings and goings. Their displays were often enacted on terrain best-known for Grand Tourism and for antiquarian interests. It was partly the presence of foreign tourists with money to spend which made Italian cities such conspicuous centers for elite consumption, including furnishing a key public for the kinds of crowd-pleasing spectacles that the <em>cavallerizzi</em> were in the business of selling. Horsemanship was itself a characteristic which could bring together diverse social categories: the art of riding was an attribute both of circus performers and of grandees.<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup> The <em>cavallerizzi</em> serve, too, as a reminder that social status was not fixed, and that the purpose of a sojourn in Italy was—at all social levels—performative, competitive and even transformative. The servant Thomas Hammond provides a remarkable example of this. Not only did Hammond transcend societal expectations by writing up his memoirs, so immortalizing his life and career, but one of his text’s delights is its shifting linguistic registers—including, as we have seen, describing scenes he observed in Venice by invoking analogies with classical mythology (“those black Gondoloes looked as if they had been a troop of Ghosts that Mercury had conducted to the borders of the River Styx to be wafted over by the inexorable Charon into the Elysian fields”), thus further announcing his autodidactic virtuosity.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if some of the considerations discussed here highlight the need, when using the <em>Explorer</em>, to recognize the various layers of source production, survival, selection and interpretation which have structured its contents, they also help provide an intellectual genealogy for the project itself. The “art of travel” as constructed during the early modern period was entangled with observation, recording, and collecting.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup> But so, too, were host governments anxious to register and measure the movements and activities of foreigners in their midst. One of the points of interest of the <em>Dictionary</em> is precisely that, in its ambitious and innovative source base, it brings together these two documentary impulses. In terms of social coverage, the results are, if not straightforwardly quantitatively representative, nevertheless of often impressive variety. The <em>Explorer</em> gives us new ways of approaching this material, and indeed of reading the <em>Dictionary</em> against the grain of its original intentions. The <em>Dictionary</em> was presented as having been primarily designed to answer questions, “were they in Italy?” and if so, “when and where.”<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup> The <em>Explorer</em>, however, permits us not only to revisit such questions, but to frame new ones. As this essay has sought to show, approaching this material by searching not for a named or notable individual, but instead for wider socio-cultural categories and careers, can help reveal a host of more eclectic and obscure personal trajectories, with potentially kaleidoscopic results.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></p>\n\n<p>Research behind this essay was funded by a Rome Scholarship at the British School at Rome (2010–11), and a Max Weber Fellowship at the European University Institute, Florence (2015–16).

        "content"  : "<p>My interest in the Grand Tour explorer arises out of my own work on the engagement of British travelers with Italian cities during the long eighteenth century. Some years ago, I published a book that concentrated upon British experiences and representations of Italian cities during the long eighteenth century, Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c. 1690-1820.1 As an urban historian, I was less concerned with what was collected or purchased by travelers, or with their social networks, than with exploring how images of major Italian cities were constructed and considering their influence in British culture. Given the opportunity to work with the Grand Tour Explorer, I wanted to use it to pursue several questions.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Like many historians, years of immersion in the primary sources meant that I had an intuitive sense of evolving patterns of travel and the composition of the traveling body. However, I was unable to provide any rigorous quantifiable basis for my conclusions or generalizations. How far were my generalizations borne out by the evidence of the Explorer, while taking into account the complex nature of its data, which we know to be far from complete (see the introduction of the book)? What new light could the Explorer cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the Explorer tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body? The dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste, acquired and polished in Italy, exercised such a powerful influence upon Britain’s eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.2 But it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic grand tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out throughout my book was the increasing presence of both female travelers and travelers from beyond the landed elite over the course of the eighteenth century, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book: Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile: such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa and Leghorn.</p>\n"

        "content"  : "<p>By the seventeenth century, British travelers had already caught the travel bug. They expressed sentiments strikingly similar to those of modern globetrotters. An early “Grand Tour” account, <em>Coryat’s Crudities</em> (1611), satirized how even the hint of foreign climes could infect an armchair traveler:</p>\n\n<blockquote>A Dutch Post doth ravish him. The mere superscription of a letter from Zurich sets him up like a top: Basil or Heidelberg makes him spinne. And at seeing the word Frankford, or Venice, though but on the title of a Booke, he is readie to breake doublet, cracke elbowes, and overflowe the roome with his murmure…<span><sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>This was wanderlust as mania, brought on by an increasingly interconnected world. Adventurers were tempted by the Dutch packets, Swiss letters, and Italian books that had made their way North as far as Oxford and London. Thomas Coryate and many of his compatriots answered their siren calls, setting forth from their armchairs into the wider world.</p>\n\n<p>Coryate would later claim to have walked much of his journey from France to Italy and the Netherlands. His book begins with several poems referencing his shoes, which hung for many years at his local church in Somerset. But Coryate did not always walk: even at the outset of his journey, he described his wanderlust in terms of how ardently he desired “having trussed up his necessaries, and packed up his fardels, to draw on his bootes, put his riding hat upon his head, raise himselfe upon his wings, hoise sailes, and mount on horsbacke (according to the proverbe) and post the neerest way to forraine and remote Nations.”<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Sentences like these hint at the variety of travel modes available in seventeenth-century Europe. Coryate’s reference to the ravishing “Dutch Post” as a noun parallels the modern use of “post” as a synonym for “mail.” Both the noun and verb, “to post,” had only recently entered the British lexicon, from the Italian term for a staging post, or waystations that enabled riders to travel in relay.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> When Coryate used “post” as a verb instead and synonym for travel (to “post the nearest way”) he used even newer slang. The proliferation of “to post,” “go by post,” or travel “post-haste” demonstrated that the import of European travel modes to Britain was intertwined with the arrival of British tourists in Europe.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>When it works well, travel infrastructure is virtually invisible. Instead, we often find mentions of its perceived failures. Take, for example, free word searching in the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> for “postilion” (a guide hired from the post): <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2843\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Lewis Langton</a> (c.1716-1738, travel years 1737-1738) was “much harrassed by postillions, inn-keepers and coaching accidents,” while <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4434\" target=\"\\_blank\">Tobias Smollet</a> (1721-1771, travel years 1764-1771) wrote that “the hostlers, postilions, and other fellows hanging about the post-houses in Italy, are the most greedy, impertinent, and provoking.” The Hon. <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/766\" target=\"\\_blank\">Benedict Leonard Calvert</a> (c.1701-1732, travel years 1724-1725) had good reason to complain when his postilion drove into a ditch, breaking the chase and forcing him to return to Rome rather than journey onwards to Naples. Travelers complained at length about the behavior of postilions, poor condition of paved roads, and inadequacy of travel inns. Coryate’s work and hundreds of other British travel narratives are often analyzed for the sensory or philosophical experience of travel.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> Such sources do provide vivid details of exceptional experiences, but more mundane infrastructure frequently escapes notice.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth considering instead that such complaints reveal high expectations.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> By the beginning of the seventeenth century, British tourists expected a great deal of a comprehensive travel infrastructure that had simply not existed in past centuries. The history of travel necessitates quantitative, in addition to qualitative, evidence. The <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> offers a unique opportunity to study travel patterns across space, time, and political boundaries. With this broader perspective, we can determine how representative the most famous and widely published travelers were. This essay will set out to do so with an experience common to all Grand Tourists: their arrival in Italy. British travelers faced an arduous journey before ever reaching Italian soil. The compilers of the <em>Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em> were not preoccupied with that journey, yet as the <em>Explorer</em> reveals, the entries preserve many traces. Around 150 locations outside of Italy appear in the tour information, constituting 34.3% of all locations recorded, the majority of which lie North of the Alps.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>To date, Mont Cenis has traditionally been identified at the preferred Alpine Pass of the Grand Tour. Jeremy Black wrote that “the most common route into Italy was from Lyons through the Duchy of Savoy, over the Mt. Cenis pass to Susa, and thence to Turin.”<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> Christopher Hibbert similarly saw most Grand Tourists as venturing first to France, before choosing “to cross the Alps either through Grenoble, Briancon, and Cesana, or through Geneva and Switzerland,” while “the most usual route was by way of Lanslebourg and Susa over Mont Cenis.”<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> Recent authors are more equivocal, but the Savoyard route continues to receive the most scholarly attention.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> Other essays in this volume use free word searches to great effect, but the approach offers little guidance in this instance. Searches of the entry text and locations for famous Alpine passes (see <a href=\"#figure-1\">Figure 1</a>) turn up very little information: Mont Cenis returns the greatest number of results with 44 matching entries, while searching for the Brenner pass produces only five entries, the St. Gotthard only two, and the St. Bernard passes do not appear at all.<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup> Instead, this essay will seek to read across the geography of the tour data to infer regions of entry into Italy and the modes of travel being used. Inferring the Alpine pass of entry into Italy from the <em>Explorer</em> data reveals that traveler choices were more varied than typically assumed and often tied to travel infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>This essay also seeks to elucidate the British arrival to Italy as an overall historical phenomenon. The <em>Dictionary</em> bisects the history of travel with a largely arbitrary date of 1700. By putting study of the <em>Explorer</em> in dialogue with earlier sources—including Thomas Coryate, among many others—we may better understand the <em>longue durée</em> of the Grand Tour, as well as its significance as a reflection of improving travel infrastructure.<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> Postal routes and waystations marked improvements in “soft infrastructure” that predated many road engineering projects. Alpine passes were fundamentally limited in number in the early modern world, and very little construction to add new routes took place between the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries.<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup> The travel of eighteenth-century British Grand Tourists can be fruitfully compared to earlier centuries as a reflection of the shifting preferences and conditions for, rather than geographical possibilities of, transalpine travel.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\"> <img src=\"midura-figure-1.png\" id=\"fig1\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1\">\n\n<b>Fig. 1:</b> Map of Alpine passes and “indicator” cities, which have been used to infer probable routes of entry into Italy.

The Roman Empire established an early pattern of travel infrastructure radiating outwards from Italy into other parts of Europe. The Via Julia Augusta (c. 13 B.C.E.) followed the coast of Liguria, linking Genoa to Marseille, while the Via Claudia Augusta (c. 46/47 C.E.) linked the Veneto region to the Tyrol and beyond, by way of the Brenner pass. Archaeological evidence indicates additional Roman roads in the region of the Simplon pass in the first centuries of the new millennium, likely related to the campaigns of Septimius Severus I (193-211 C.E.).<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> Grand Tourists primarily remembered exceptional Alpine crossings, from Hannibal’s legendary elephants (218 C.E.) to Charlemagne (800 C.E.) and Frederick Barbarossa’s imperial armies (c. 1154-1175 C.E.).</p>\n\n<p>While Roman infrastructure fell into disrepair, smaller-scale mobility continued throughout the Middle Ages. Transalpine trade linked the hubs of Northern Italy with France, particularly the trade fairs in the region of Champagne. The closure of these fairs in the early fourteenth century saw a rise in traffic across the eastern Alpine passes, as merchants sought new transalpine connections between Bologna, Venice, Nuremberg, and Augsburg. Some merchants even took basic road building into their own hands: Bozen merchant Heinrich Kunter sponsored the building of a mule road through the Eisack gorge along the Brenner pass in 1314.<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> In the sixteenth century, the Fugger family of merchant-bankers paid to revitalize parts of the Via Claudia Augusta, referred to as the <em>Römerstrasse</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Transalpine regions had been the birthplace for much of early modern travel and communication infrastructure. The Tassis family—whose ancestral home in Camerata Cornello was located along the medieval Via Mercatorum—were one of several families contracted to build and manage routes for early modern states. Better known by their later title of Thurn und Taxis, this communications dynasty played a crucial role in the Venetian, Papal, Spanish, and Austrian Habsburg systems from the fifteenth century onward.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> Responding to news-hungry patrons, from princes to bankers, they established postal routes dotted with waystations with horses kept ready for riding in relay. Many of these waystations were themselves inns, where the innkeeper might rent out horses to travelers when they were not otherwise in use. The Tassis established such waystations along historical routes from Milan to the Netherlands through Chur in 1496, and from Milan to Innsbruck in 1517.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup>\nTo travel “by the post” encompassed several modes by as early as the sixteenth century. The first was to rent a “post horse,” then travel with or without a guide (a “postilion,” or <em>postiglione</em>) along the postal road, paying a fee for the return of the horse to its owner at the end of the journey. The second was to travel by one’s own means along the postal road, taking advantage of the stops. The British adopted the Italian <em>ordinari</em>, which usually referred to couriers traveling on a set timetable, to refer instead to the “ordinaries,” or postal inns. By the early seventeenth century, the third option was often to travel via a public postal coach, often referred to as the “post-chaise” (from the French) or “diligence” (from the German).<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>By the mid-seventeenth century, the British were frequently as steeped in the culture of postal transport as their Continental counterparts—despite the relatively late advent of their own state-run service.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> The language of the post percolated from Italy across Europe in the sixteenth century: <em>posta</em>, <em>ordinario</em>, <em>procaccio</em> (a single route carrier), <em>vetturino</em> and <em>nolesino</em> (referring to coaches for hire). The term “post-haste” made a notable appearance in Shakespeare’s plays.<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup> British translators made postal itinerary books available to English audiences with Richard Verstegan’s <em>The Posts of the World</em> (1576), John Wadsworth’s <em>The European Mercury</em> (1641), and Edmund Warcupp’s <em>Italy in its Original Glory</em> (1660).<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The paths of British travelers were dispersed across a broad geography from their points of entry onto the Continent, but they were grouped together once more upon reaching the Alps. Liguria had several coastal routes, including the aforementioned Via Julia Augusta through Savona. Travelers coming from Geneva often crossed Savoy and traveled through the Mont Cenis and St. Bernard passes (known as the “Little,” and “Great,” respectively); meanwhile Lombardy channeled travelers from other parts of Switzerland through the Simplon, St. Gotthard and San Bernardino passes. Finally, the Venetian/Tyrolean region received tourists from southern Germany and Austria, most often via the Brenner pass.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n    \n<a name=\"figure-2\"> <img src=\"midura-figure-2.jpeg\" id=\"fig2\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>\n    \n<figcaption id=\"cap2\">\n \n<b>Fig. 2:</b> Wilhelm Rothe, according to drawings by Johann Gottfried Jentzsch. <i>Grande roûte au mont St. Gotthardt, en Suisse non loin de l'Hospice di Jentzsch</i>. c. 1790-1800.

Most land routes had long portions that could only be passed on foot, on mule, or by sedan chair. Early seventeenth-century traveler Fynes Moryson preserves a particularly vivid image. He described pressing his face to his horse’s neck, fearing he would fall at any minute.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> Thomas Coryate recalled the storms during his summer passage of 1608 through Savoy as particularly horrible.<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> In the later seventeenth century the Alps occasioned less fearful commentary. With the exception of his fear of the “rough way,” Lassels described his 1650s voyage through the Simplon Pass as “forward enough,” barring poor weather. He particularly endorsed the route through Mont Cenis, describing it as the Alps in “text hand,” comparing the topography to neat script, as opposed to areas that seemed “foule over” or “in a running hand.”<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> François Misson offered one of the first proto-Romantic accounts of the Alps, writing that “their Snowy tops are mingled with the Clouds, and resemble very much the swelling and foaming Waves of a tempestuous and raging Sea.”<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> The growing geological and scenographic attraction of the Alps for British travelers is a well-documented phenomenon.<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a name=\"figure-3\"></a></p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Travel Account</th>\n      <th>Travel Dates</th>\n      <th>Region(s) of Entry to Italy</th>\n      <th>Region(s) of Departure from Italy</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Thomas William</td>\n      <td><i>The Historie of Italie</i> (MS)</td>\n      <td>1540s</td>\n      <td>Naples</td>\n      <td>Lombardy</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Thomas Hoby</td>\n      <td><i>A Book of the Travaile and Lief of Me Thomas Hoby</i> (MS)</td>\n      <td>1547-1564</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Sir Edward Unton</td>\n      <td>Diary (MS)</td>\n      <td>1564</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n      <td>Lombardy</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Sir Phillip Sidney</td>\n      <td>Letters (MS)</td>\n      <td>1575</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Fynes Moryson</td>\n      <td><i>An Itinerary..

Protestants like Fynes Moryson professed fear of capture by Spanish troops and inquisitors, but it was hard to beat these regions for travel infrastructure in the seventeenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> Venice and Milan were notable centers of early Tassis postal development with well-developed postal roads and travel modes for rent. A longstanding agreement between Milan and the merchant porters of Lindau in Bavaria became a more formalized postal route by the late seventeenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> By 1710, four-span carriages traveled along the postal road between Innsbruck and Bolzano three to four times a week.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> Second, we see that many early travelers, like their later counterparts, preferred to exit Italy from a different region than they entered, likely motivated by a desire for travel breadth and variety. Finally, many of these examples confirm that travelers preferred the dangers of the Alps to the perils of the sea.<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The analysis shown in <a href=\"#figure-3\">Figure 3</a> has distinct limitations. These are but a handful of travelers, and each identification requires consulting their accounts individually. We are left with little sense of how representative these journeys were, or of how trends evolved over time. By contrast, the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> allowed me to rapidly infer the regions of entry of eighteenth-century British travelers into Italy. This approach was made possible by both the constrained geography of alpine passes and the sequential records of locations provided in the <em>Explorer</em> entries. If an individual is first recorded in Turin and then Milan, for example, it is a reasonable inference that they entered Italy by way of a Savoyard alpine pass. Clues can be read alongside select traveler accounts as well as supplemented by a knowledge of contemporary travel infrastructure. While closer to Verona than Milan “as the crow flies,” Mantua had long been integrated into Habsburg transit infrastructure in northern Italy. It is reasonable to infer that a traveler who arrived in Mantua did so by way of the Lombard passes, especially when such an arrival was not preceded by any mention of cities in the Veneto or Tyrol regions.\nIt is important not to overdetermine the specificity of results from such a method. It would be misguided, for example, to infer a single route. Regional groups instead represent collections of routes, such as “Lombardy,” which encompasses the Simplon, St. Gotthard, or San Bernardino passes, among others. These regional groupings and their associated cities can be found listed in the legend and color-coded accordingly in <a href=\"#figure-1\">Figure 1</a>. They are necessitated by both the ambiguities of real geography and that of travel modes. Arrival in a port city such as Venice or Genoa might indicate a journey by sea rather than over land. Definitively parsing all instances would require archival study outside of the <em>Explorer</em>. We can, however, see whether the trajectory of travel through the Tyrol/Veneto more closely parallels that of a region reached by port, such as Tuscany, or regions reached primarily by land, such as Lombardy.<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> While imperfect, such an inferential methodology fills in for a noteworthy absence. Alpine passes rarely appear by name in entry texts, and even more rarely as explicit destinations.</p>\n\n<p>The method is also not appropriate for use with all traveler entries. The following analysis uses a subset of 999 travelers from the <em>Explorer</em> for which a region of entry into Italy can be reasonably inferred, based on two criteria: first, each traveler has to be associated with at least three locations overall. Second, departure from the first location in Italy (regarded as the point of entry) must be followed by another location recorded within the month. This selection is intended to serve as a counterweight to sparse data. It is difficult to say whether a traveler recorded in only a single location entered Italy in that manner, or whether three locations visited over the course of several decades should constitute a sequence of travel. These strict criteria produce a small subset compared to the <em>Explorer</em>’s total of 6,005 travelers, but a large one by comparison to any hand-selected subset, such as that shown in <a href=\"#figure-3\">Figure 3</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\"> <img src=\"midura-figure-4.png\" id=\"fig4\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig3&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\n<b>Fig. 4:</b> Line graph demonstrating the identified region of entry of 999 travelers prior to 1800.

In fact, travelers appear to have preferred the Venetian/Tyrolean region through the first half of the eighteenth century. And while the Savoyard passes maintained a steady flow of travelers during periods of French-English warfare from 1771-1790, the Tyrolean/Venetian region boomed by comparison.<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup>\nMany of the caveats that hold true for the original biographical dictionary still necessarily apply, and the <em>Explorer</em> introduces some additional ones. For example, the lifespan of certain sources certainly impacts recorded travelers. As explained in Ingamells’ original “Note on Method” and <a href=\"/gt-book/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled\" target=\"\\_blank\">mentioned by Rosemary Sweet</a> and others, the University of Padua matriculation records were the source for a great number of the overall travels to the city recorded in the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup> These records became less comprehensive over time. Additionally, the Explorer’s transformation of the Dictionary’s entries disaggregated some large groups of travelers, perhaps disproportionately affecting the data for my study. See, for example, the numerous family of <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4692\" target=\"\\_blank\">Rev. Edward Taylor</a> (1734-1798, travel years 1789-1792), many of whom accompanied him from Austria to Verona in 1789, and who constituted 10 of the 21 travelers recorded entering via the Tyrol/Veneto that year.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Even given these limitations, the data supports that travelers continued to prefer the Tyrolean/Venetian region as a pass of entry. While Grand Tour literature has tended to link British travels in Italy with travels in France, the data indicates the need for deeper consideration of Austria and Germany as pre-Italian destinations. These regions had their own appeal to travelers like <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2188\" target=\"\\_blank\">Sir James, the 4th Baronet Hall</a> (1761-1832, travel years 1784-1785), who spent a year in Central and Eastern Europe studying “mining, archaeological sites and volcanology.” Many travelers through the Tyrolean/Venetian region came from Vienna. Some were more traditionally elite tourists, such as <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2203\" target=\"\\_blank\">Douglas Hamilton, the 8th Duke of Hamilton</a> (1756-1799, travel years 1775-1776), who traveled with tutor <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3413\" target=\"\\_blank\">Dr. John Moore</a> (1729-1802, travel years 1775-1776), or <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1030\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lady Coke</a> (1726-1811, travel years 1773-1774), who greatly admired the Empress Theresa and reputedly displayed a “frenzy for royalty.” Yet a number of these travelers held military commissions and visited Vienna, then Venice, during the conflicts of the mid-1770s, perhaps during their military studies—see, for example, the Hon. <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3175\" target=\"\\_blank\">Robert Manners</a> (1758-1823, travel year 1779) and <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5229\" target=\"\\_blank\">Nathaniel William Wraxall</a> (1751-1831, travel year 1779).<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The city of Venice was itself a popular draw for tourists, raising the issue of how closely entry through a given region can be associated with the popularity of its cities. If we look at the overall popularity of Venice as a destination across the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> data, we see that it does not map exactly onto the preference for the Tyrol/Veneto as a region of entry. The city of Venice experienced a surge of travelers from 1761-1770, when the Tyrolean/Venetian passes were at an overall low point in popularity.<sup id=\"fnref:40\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></sup> In fact, the popularity of a city may have had a greater impact on tourists’ choice to end, rather than begin, a journey in that region. A sea voyage from Venice would notably allow tourists to ship home art and other objects collected in the course of their journeys.</p>\n\n<p>The Imperial and Venetian posts were among the most advanced and comprehensive postal infrastructures of the early seventeenth century. It was possible to travel by Imperial post alone from the Netherlands to Innsbruck, where the passage to Venice by coaches for hire was run by a consortium of Augsburg merchants. Misson highlights the stage coaches that went from Augsburg to Venice as early as the 1680s.<sup id=\"fnref:41\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></sup> Despite the attempts by the Tassis (now Thurn und Taxis) postmasters to combat their competitors, there were a number of such regional postal systems that connected major trade centers in the Holy Roman Empire, and no doubt eased British travel.<sup id=\"fnref:42\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></sup> For travelers concerned by the practicalities of reaching Italy, the journey through Central Europe rather than France held a certain appeal.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5\"> <img src=\"midura-figure-5.png\" id=\"fig5\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig3&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap5\">\n\n<b>Fig. 5:</b> Line graph demonstrating the shifting numbers of travelers entering via the Tyrol/Veneto and Savoy regions. Visualization smoothed by moving average of +5/-5 years. \n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>When was the turning point in favor of the Mont Cenis and St. Bernard passes, and Savoy as a region of entry? In 1720, Victor Amadeus II, the Duke of Savoy became the King of Sardinia, turning his court into a royal one. Travelers such as the <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/556\" target=\"\\_blank\">Rev. Thomas Brand</a> (c.1751-1814, travel years 1782-1784, 1787, 1790-1795) delighted in court life, describing how “we go on in the old way playing snug rubbers at Whist at the Spanish Ambassadors &amp; dressing ourselves two or three times a week to shew off our persons to advantage &amp; captivate the hearts &amp; Eyes of the great Circles.” Yet the <em>Explorer</em> data shows no immediate change, and few travelers entered through Savoy in the 1720s.<sup id=\"fnref:43\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></sup> A much more notable increase began in the 1750s, reaching a peak of 25 identified travelers in 1763 (24 of the 39 identified travelers for that year, or 62%). <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4475\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Spencer, the 1st Viscount Spencer</a> (1734-1783, travel years 1763-1764, 1769-1770), was the leader of a particularly large and well-documented entourage that year, however there was a general pattern of increasing traffic. Travelers tended to arrive in Savoy en route from Paris (23 travelers), Geneva (13 travelers), and Nice (11 travelers). In 1743, Savoy gained possession of the Val d’Ossola and Val Anzasca passes from Austrian Lombardy. A new agreement between Savoy and Bern the next year restructured and facilitated transit between the two regions. Yet in 1748, <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2575\" target=\"\\_blank\">David Hume</a> (1711-1776, travel year 1748) and his companions remained unimpressed by the bad roads of Turin, which caused delays from the “breaking of Wheels.”</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the Austrian Habsburgs set out an ambitious program for infrastructural reform. From the middle of the eighteenth century, they controlled both the Lombard St. Gotthard and Venetian Brenner passes. In the 1750s and 1760s, Empress Maria Theresa seized control of the Tyrolean postal service and implemented renewal of both the system itself and the roads. The Imperial Post achieved a major coup in 1764 by successfully negotiating a mail coach to supplement the existing line across the Brenner pass. Even travelers who utilized private carriages benefited from the associated improvements. As overall British tourism increased, the Tyrolean/Venetian region saw a large proportion of visitors, notably outpacing Savoy once again by around 1774.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-6\"> <img src=\"midura-figure-6.png\" id=\"fig6\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig3&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap6\">\n\n<b>Fig. 6:</b> Line graph demonstrating the shifting numbers of travelers entering via Liguria and Tuscany. Visualization smoothed by moving average of +5/-5 years. \n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>While Grand Tour scholars like Jeremy Black have indicated that war caused little disruption in existing travel patterns, it does appear that soured Anglo-French relations may have made a significant difference.<sup id=\"fnref:44\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></sup> Bianchi notes that the Savoyard route was largely closed to British travelers in the 1740s as a result of the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748).<sup id=\"fnref:45\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></sup> The period of the American and French Revolutions also saw a dip in overall travelers, reaching a particular low in 1781, when only 217 travelers are recorded in the <em>Explorer</em>. Only one of these has been identified as entering Italy via the given regions in this year: the Hon. <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3492\" target=\"\\_blank\">Gen. James Murray</a> (1719-1794, travel years 1781-1782), who fled the French siege of Minorca. The anomalous peak in travelers entering Italy via Liguria in 1778 (9 of 25 identified travelers that year, or 36%) was likely due to restricted options. The very next year saw the capture of the Westmoreland and plunder of many Grand Tourist souvenirs by Spanish ships.<sup id=\"fnref:46\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></sup> Occupations rather than tourism brought others to Italy, such as the surgeon <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/855\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Gideon Caulet</a> (travel years 1778-1779), or the musician <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1215\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Crosdill</a> (1755-1825, travel year 1778).</p>\n\n<p>Do these shifts show a corresponding shift in preference for travel by sea or travel by land? If that were the case, we would expect to see Lombardy and Savoy (land routes) peak in periods when Liguria and “Other” (a category including most regions that could be reached only by sea) were at a low, and vice versa (see <a href=\"#figure-4\">Figure 4</a>). We instead see a more complex picture: Liguria and Tuscany show an inverse relationship, particularly from 1778 forward (see <a href=\"#figure-6\">Figure 6</a>). The rivalry of ports seems a more influential factor: as the popularity of the port of Leghorn grew, the popularity of the port of Genoa fell, at least with British Grand Tourists.<sup id=\"fnref:47\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Across the graph, we see several phases of regional preferences for entry into Italy. The overall increase in travelers over the course of 1720s and 1730s likely continued trends from the later seventeenth century. Early travelers appreciated the convenience and safety of continental postal routes, particularly the coaches run over the Brenner pass. From around 1730 forward, the number of travelers through this region dwindled, reaching a low around the beginning of the 1750s, just as the Savoyard passes increased in popularity. The timing suggests that infrastructural reform, rather than the new royal court, likely played a role. Subsequent decades saw important reforms by the Austrian Habsburgs, including consolidation and improvement of postal routes, particularly the advent of an official postal coach across the Alps. During the troubled decades of the 1770s and 1780s, most regions saw fewer travelers entering Italy, leaving Liguria briefly prominent among entry points. By the 1790s, tourism had recovered somewhat overall, but entry via Venice reached record numbers, and the Tuscan port of Leghorn showed steady growth, suggesting perhaps a new turn to travel by sea, even in the age of rising tourist interest in the Alps.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tastemakers and Mont Cenis: Traveler preferences for arrival into Italy</strong></p>\n\n<p><a name=\"figure-7\"></a></p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Titled Status</th>\n      <th>Liguria</th>\n      <th>Lombardy</th>\n      <th>Savoy</th>\n      <th>Tyrol/Veneto</th>\n      <th>Tuscany</th>\n      <th>Other</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>All</b></td>\n      <td><b>12.9%</b></td>\n      <td><b>4.2%</b></td>\n      <td><b>22.5%</b></td>\n      <td><b>20.5%</b></td>\n      <td><b>15.5%</b></td>\n      <td><b>24.5%</b></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Men (all)</b></td>\n      <td><b>11.9%</b></td>\n      <td><b>3.8%</b></td>\n      <td><b>21.9%</b></td>\n      <td><b>21.0%</b></td>\n      <td><b>15.6%</b></td>\n      <td><b>25.8%</b></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Untitled Men</td>\n      <td>10.8%</td>\n      <td>3.8%</td>\n      <td>22.2%</td>\n      <td>20.1%</td>\n      <td>15.9%</td>\n      <td>27.1%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Titled Men</td>\n      <td>16.6%</td>\n      <td>3.6%</td>\n      <td>20.7%</td>\n      <td>24.9%</td>\n      <td>14.2%</td>\n      <td>20.1%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Women (all</b>)</td>\n      <td><b>19.3%</b></td>\n      <td><b>6.6%</b></td>\n      <td><b>21.1%</b></td>\n      <td><b>19.3%</b></td>\n      <td><b>16.3%</b></td>\n      <td><b>17.5%</b></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Untitled Women</td>\n      <td>19.4%</td>\n      <td>8.5%</td>\n      <td>18.6%</td>\n      <td>20.2%</td>\n      <td>13.2%</td>\n      <td>20.2%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Titled Women</td>\n      <td>18.9%</td>\n      <td>0.0%</td>\n      <td>29.7%</td>\n      <td>16.2%</td>\n      <td>27.0%</td>\n      <td>8.1%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n\n<figcaption><b>Fig. 7:</b> Table showing regional distribution by traveler gender and titled status (travelers of unknown gender not shown).

Some, like the composer <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5047\" target=\"\\_blank\">Charles Weichsell</a> (c.1766-1805, travel years 1794-1801), landed first in Naples.<sup id=\"fnref:49\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:49\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></sup> Untitled men arriving via the Alps seem most likely to have done so via Savoy.\nThe greatest overall difference between titled and untitled men was in fact the Ligurian route, which titled men were more likely to have utilized than their untitled counterparts. Many travelers came to Genoa from France, often taking a felucca, a type of rowboat, as Joseph Addison described in his published account: “we here took a little Boat to creep along the Sea-shore as far as Genoa; but at Savona, finding the Sea too rough, we were forced to make the best of our way by Land, over very rugged Mountains and Precipices: For this Road is much more difficult than that over Mount Cenis.”<sup id=\"fnref:50\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:50\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">50</a></sup> <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2121\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Egerton, Baron Grey de Wilton</a> (1749-1814, travel years 1785, 1788), recorded his journey from Nice to Genoa by sea in 1784, staying at the <em>Hotel du Grand Cerf</em> in Nice before departing for Genoa on a felucca. Many tourists opted to enter Italy via Liguria while on their second tour, perhaps suggesting a desire for speed rather than sightseeing; this includes <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2592\" target=\"\\_blank\">Alexander Gordon, Marquess of Huntly</a> (c.1678-1728, travel years 1703-1704, 1717), in 1717 and <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3919\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Fermor, the 1st Earl of Pomfret</a> (1698-1753, travel years 1718-1719, 1739-1742), in 1739. Among titled men, there appears to have been a slight preference for the Tyrol/Veneto passes, however among men of both statuses, the distribution between Savoy and Tyrol/Veneto was relatively even.</p>\n\n<p>The routes of female travelers—who often traveled with, or were recorded by, other male travelers—map onto male travel patterns with a few interesting exceptions. First, both titled and untitled women were more likely to arrive via Liguria than their male counterparts. Unlike the men, untitled women were even more likely than their titled counterparts to arrive by this route, with many entries describing that they traveled by sea. Examples include <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/852\" target=\"\\_blank\">Miss Mary Anne Cathcart</a> [Mary Mainie] (1727-1774, travel years 1744-1746), who journeyed from Lisbon to Genoa in 1744, and <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2533\" target=\"\\_blank\">Laetitia Houblon</a> (1742-1828, travel years 1788-1789) and <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5012\" target=\"\\_blank\">Betsy Watson</a> (travel years 1788-1789), who came from Nice in 1788.\nSecond, titled women appear more likely to arrive via Tuscany than any other group. 10 of the total 37 identified titled female travelers were first recorded in Pisa, Lucca, or Florence. Their arrival by sea is rarely explicitly mentioned in the entries, but can be reasonably inferred.<sup id=\"fnref:51\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:51\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></sup> Similarly, while the complete absence of titled women entering Italy via Lombardy may be a simple lack of data, it does seem to overall be one of the least popular routes for female travelers. <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3324\" target=\"\\_blank\">Anne Miller</a> (1741-1781, travel years 1770-1771), <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3880\" target=\"\\_blank\">Hester Piozzi</a> (1741-1821, travel years 1784-1787), and <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4512\" target=\"\\_blank\">Mariana Starke</a> (1762-1838, travel years 1792-1798) came to Italy by way of Savoy, although Starke recommended that travelers avoid the Alps by sailing to Leghorn or Pisa.<sup id=\"fnref:52\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></sup> The possibility that women increasingly found sea travel more commodious than travel by land is worthy of further exploration. It may well have offered more privacy and safety to women who could afford it. The published travel accounts of elite men and women also routinely advertised the Savoyard route as one of the safest and most pleasant, likely influencing future travelers.</p>\n\n<p>At this point in time, we may merely indicate that as recorded by the <em>Dictionary</em>, there was a general preference for arrival via either the Tyrol/Veneto or Savoy Alpine passes, from which certain key groups diverged. Women on the whole were more likely to arrive via Liguria, most likely by sea. Titled women were especially likely to arrive via Savoy, although Tuscany was also widely popular. If we consider only travelers prior to 1751, we see that these gender and titled status patterns generally hold true across time, despite the overall balance between Savoy and the Tyrol/Veneto being more evenly distributed in the earlier half of the century.\nThe prescriptiveness of published Grand Tour accounts, which sought to instruct their readers in the “correct” tour, have contributed to the notion of a single Grand Tour itinerary. We see from this study how titled men and women, particularly during the peak years of the eighteenth-century tour, preferred a Savoyard route, no doubt contributing to the scholarly perception. Yet as several essays in this volume demonstrate, British travelers planned different “tours” on the basis of their gender, professions, means and personal desires. Travel experience was also shaped by changing roads and travel modes, which were subject to periodic tides of interruption, destruction, and renewal. \nThe <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> offers us the unique ability to read travel itineraries across time, while considering such varied perspectives. We see evidence for continuity in travel patterns from the late seventeenth century into the eighteenth, as tourists continued to visit Austria and Germany as well as France prior to their Italian arrival. The postal infrastructural improvements made in Savoy likely contributed to its brief peak as the predominant pass of entry, but the restructuring of the Tyrol/Veneto regional infrastructure brought it back to prominence by the end of the eighteenth century. However, not every group experienced these shifts to the same degree: women overall showed an early and consistent preference for travel via Liguria. Titled women had a strong early preference for Savoy, suggesting they may have played an important role as “tastemakers.” The <em>Explorer</em> on the whole highlights the diversity of tours, and the many factors guiding British travelers to their arrival in Italy.</p>\n\n<h3>References</h3>\n\n<div class=\"overlay\" id=\"popup\" style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column; flex-wrap: wrap; background: #f7f6f3\">\n    <div id=\"imgs\" style=\"height:80%\">\n        <div class=\"overlay-close\">\n            <a><i class=\"material-icons\">close</i></a>\n        </div>\n        <img id=\"img\" />\n        <img id=\"img2\" />\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"capWrapper\" style=\"height:20%\">\n        <p id=\"cap\" style=\"float:left; max-width:80%; position:relative; left:120px; display:inline-block\"></p>\n        <div style=\"display:inline-block; float: right\">\n            <div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column; position:relative; right:100px; top:20px\">\n                <i class=\"material-icons link-cite\" aria-label=\"Cite this image\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">format_quote</i>\n                <i class=\"material-icons link-copy\" aria-label=\"Copy link to this image\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">link</i>\n                <i class=\"material-icons\" aria-label=\"Download\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">arrow_downward</i>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nfunction zoom(obj, obj2, caption) {\n    var popup = document.getElementById(\"popup\");\n    popup.style.maxHeight = \"90%\";\n    popup.style.height = \"90%\"\n    var image = document.getElementById(\"img\");\n    var image2 = document.getElementById(\"img2\");\n        \n    image.src = obj.src;\n    image.style.display = \"block\";\n    image.style.marginLeft = \"auto\";\n    image.style.marginRight = \"auto\";\n    image.style.left = \"0\";\n    image.style.right = \"0\";\n    image.style.width = \"100%\";\n    image.style.height = \"100%\";\n    image.style.objectFit = \"contain\";\n\n    image2.style.display = \"none\"; // hide in case Fig 1 or 2 were clicked\n    document.getElementById(\"capWrapper\").style.width = image.offsetWidth;\n\n    if (obj2 != undefined && obj2 != null) { // Figure 1 & 2 are paired\n        image.style.float = \"left\";\n        image.style.width = \"50%\";\n\n        image2.src = obj2.src;\n        \n        image2.style.display = \"block\";\n        image2.style.marginLeft = \"auto\";\n        image2.style.marginRight = \"auto\";\n        image2.style.left = \"0\";\n        image2.style.right = \"0\";\n        image2.style.float = \"left\";\n        image2.style.width = \"50%\";\n        image2.style.height = \"100%\";\n        image2.style.objectFit = \"contain\";\n\n        document.getElementById(\"capWrapper\").style.width = image.offsetWidth + image2.offsetWidth; \n    }\n    var cap = document.getElementById(\"cap\");\n    if (caption != undefined && caption != null) {\n        cap.innerHTML = caption.innerHTML;\n        cap.style.display = \"block\";\n        cap.style.marginTop = \"20px\";\n    } else {\n        cap.style.display = \"none\";\n    }\n    var overlays = document.getElementsByClassName(\"overlay\");\n      for (overlay of overlays) {\n        overlay.classList.remove(\"visible\");\n      }\n    popup.classList.add(\"visible\"); \n}    \n</script>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>Thomas Coryate, <em>Coryats Crudities: Hastily Gobled Up in Five Months Travells in France, Savoy, Italy, Rhetia Commonly Called the Grisons Country, Helvetia Alias Switzerland, Some Parts of High Germany and the Netherlands</em> … (London: Printed by W.S.

        "content"  : "<p>The Grand Tour was critical to establishing the demand for many of the resources and phenomena that we associate with modern cultural tourism, such as maps, guidebooks, itineraries, souvenirs, and tour guides. On his visit to Rome in 1644, the British writer John Evelyn toured with one of the latter, “who get their living onely by leading strangers about to see the Citty.”<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Scant information survives on seventeenth-century guides, but the call for their services continued as the popularity of travel grew. Known in the eighteenth century as <em>ciceroni</em> or cicerones, guides explicated the great antiquities, artworks, buildings, and sights of Italy to visitors who came from all over Europe to see them.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Tourists, especially young men for whom travel was intended to be educational, may also have been escorted by “bear leaders,” tutors, or governors, but these were chaperones rather than guides and sometimes accompanied their charges on tours with <em>ciceroni</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> This essay will examine the work of <em>ciceroni</em> and the experiences of their clients on the Grand Tour.</p>\n\n<p>Although there have been a few studies of individual <em>ciceroni</em>, they have not been considered systematically as a group. Relatively few <em>ciceroni</em> are known to us, most of them British, along with some Italians and at least one German. The fundamental published source for many of these figures is John Ingamells’ <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Ford archive, but it is not indexed, so information can be difficult to find in its entries.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> The <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em>’s digital transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em> allowed me to begin a more thorough study of the subject. Using the pre-selected list of employments and identifiers in the <em>Explorer</em> or conducting free searches, I searched various terms—“antiquarian,” “antiquary,” <em>cicerone</em> (singular), <em>ciceroni</em> (plural) and “tour guide”—and compiled a list of fifteen <em>ciceroni</em> (<a href=\"#figure-1\">Figure 1</a>). The terms <em>cicerone(i)</em> are not on the <em>Explorer</em>’s pre-selected list of employments and identifiers, though a free search brought up forty-seven entries.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"figure-1\"></a></p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><em>Cicerone</em></th>\n      <th>Number of clients found</th>\n      <th>Number of clients appearing in <em>Explorer</em></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Francesco de’ Ficoroni (1664-1747)</td>\n      <td>19</td>\n      <td>12</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Mark Parker (c. 1698-1747)</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Ridolfino Venuti (1705-1763)</td>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Abbé Peter Grant (1708-1784)</td>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717-1768)</td>\n      <td>14</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>John Parker (fl. 1740, d. 1765)</td>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>James Russel (1720-1763)</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Andrew Lumisden (1720-1801)</td>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Thomas Jenkins (1722-1798)</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Colin Morison (1732-1810)</td>\n      <td>18</td>\n      <td>18</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>James Byres (1734-1817)</td>\n      <td>49</td>\n      <td>49</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Christopher Norton (c. 1740-1799)</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>William Patoun (fl. 1761, d. 1783)</td>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>James Clark (c. 1745-1800)</td>\n      <td>17</td>\n      <td>17</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Patrick Moir (1769-1810)</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n      <td><strong>142</strong></td>\n      <td><strong>126</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n\n<figcaption><b>Fig. 1:</b><i>Ciceroni</i> of the Grand Tour.

Searching within the <em>Explorer</em> for entries related to each <em>cicerone</em>, I compiled a list of clients who toured with specific guides (Appendix).  For each client I collected various sorts of information to see what—if any—patterns emerged pertaining to class, gender, occupation, education, and religion (<a href=\"#figure-2\">Figure 2</a>). My aim also was to learn why tourists hired guides and why specific ones and how they experienced and thought about their time with them.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"figure-2\"></a></p>\n\n<table>\n

Rome, the exception being <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/952\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Clark</a> (c. 1754-1800, travel years 1768-1800), who was a guide in Naples. With its unique abundance of monuments, Rome was a place where tours were especially desirable. As the seat of the Jacobite court in exile, it was home to many British Catholics; a number of the <em>ciceroni</em> on my list were Scottish Jacobites or sympathizers. British guides usually had travelled to Rome to study painting, less often sculpture or architecture, but may not have been so successful in those professions and at any rate developed a great interest in antiquities and cultivated their knowledge of them.</p>\n\n<p>The first known <em>cicerone</em> of the eighteenth century appears to have been an Italian, Francesco de’ Ficoroni (1664-1747). A native of Lazio, Ficoroni was the most sought-after antiquarian in Rome from 1690 to 1745. In addition to working as a <em>cicerone</em>, overseeing excavations, and publishing his scholarship, he collected and dealt in antiquities, as did many antiquarians, connoisseurs, scholars, and tour guides. As Tamara Griggs has demonstrated, Ficoroni’s contribution to guiding was to adapt the Roman tradition of antiquarianism to the interests of Grand Tourists.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In his <em>Osservazioni di Francesco de’Ficoroni sopra l’antichità di Roma</em> of 1709, Ficoroni listed an array of aristocratic clients whom he had led around Rome, particularly the catacombs, evidence that the services of <em>ciceroni</em> were already popular at the beginning of the eighteenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> His clients hailed not only from Britain, but also from France, Sweden, Denmark, Flanders, Holland, and Germany. Did Ficoroni speak to them in Italian? In the seventeenth century Italian was an international language of diplomacy and music; travelers may have had some knowledge of it, but how many could have fully understood it and conversed in it? This factor may partly account for the popularity of British <em>ciceroni</em> among a tourist population dominated by Britons. Nonetheless, Ficoroni’s first recorded client was the well-known British politician and writer <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/29\" target=\"\\_blank\">Joseph Addison</a> (1672-1719, travel years 1700-1701), who is documented to have been the first to use the term <em>ciceroni</em> in 1726.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>A later Italian <em>cicerone</em> was Ridolfino Venuti (1705-1763), a highly respected scholar who was appointed <em>Commissario delle Antichità</em> (Prefect of Papal Antiquities) in 1744.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> One of the duties of the papal antiquarian was to guide important visitors around Rome, but according to Venuti’s famous successor in the post, Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Venuti was unable to live on his salary of 180 <em>scudi</em> per annum and took on other wealthy travelers as clients to supplement his income, a practice which apparently proved quite lucrative. Winckelmann succeeded Venuti in 1763, the only non-Italian to ever hold the position, an indication of the esteem in which the German antiquarian was held.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> He did not share his predecessor’s interest in escorting travelers around Rome, especially the British and the French, whom he respectively regarded as humorless and frivolous. He was, of course, more tolerant of Germans, especially Prince Leopold III of Anhalt-Dessau, whom he described as a “German Achilles.” Winckelmann’s tours, as we will see, reflected his idiosyncratic perspective on ancient art.</p>\n\n<p>Venuti also supplemented his income by writing guidebooks.

He entered the service of the Pope as captain of the papal galleys, but was also well known among British tourists as an antiquarian in Rome. Eventually denounced by the Jacobites as a Hanoverian spy, Parker was banished by the Inquisition in 1749 and ultimately settled in Paris. <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3732\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Parker</a> (fl. 1740-d. 1765, travel years 1740?-c. 1762), an unsuccessful  history painter unrelated to Mark, attempted to succeed him as a <em>cicerone</em> but failed, no doubt partly due to his quarrelsome nature. It was <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4179\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Russel</a> (c. 1720-63, travel years in Italy 1740-1763), who, despite being exposed as a Jacobite by John Parker, his rival for the succession, eventually followed Mark Parker as <em>cicerone</em> to the British.<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> Russel was indeed a Jacobite, from a family staunchly of that persuasion, and was rigorously educated in the classics, which nourished the growth of his antiquarian interests in Rome. He went there to study painting, which he did at the French Academy, and achieved moderate success as an artist, mostly in copying famous works for tourists. He also served as an agent for other artists. His best-known painting is a so-called “conversation piece”, set in a Roman interior, in which he pictured himself with tourists who were fellow Jacobites, wearing a tartan coat to show his sympathy for the Stuart cause.<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The major Roman <em>ciceroni</em> of the later eighteenth century were <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Colin Morison</a> (1732-1810, travel years 1754-1810), and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Byres</a> (1734-1817, travel years 1758-1790).

Norton solidified the association by marrying Byres’ niece, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3748.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Janet Moir</a>, in 1792. By that time Byres’ nephew and Janet’s cousin, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3364\" target=\"\\_blank\">Patrick Moir</a> (1769-1810, travel years 1785-1805), himself a respected antiquarian who had already been living with his uncle, took over Byres’ business as a <em>cicerone</em> and dealer.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> Norton lived until 1799 and Moir stayed in Rome until 1805, both carrying on in the tradition of Byres.</p>\n\n<p>As these examples show, leading tours was one of a constellation of activities in which antiquarians and connoisseurs, many of whom were also artists, participated in Rome. Only some of the <em>ciceroni</em> cited here—those who were able to establish a large and steady clientele—may have considered guiding tours a primary career and source of income. <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4179\" target=\"\\_blank\">Russel</a>, for instance, worked both as an artist and led tours. In a letter of 1753 to a fellow client of Russel, the scholar <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4469\" target=\"\\_blank\">Joseph Spence</a> (1699-1768, travel years 1731-1733, 1739-1741) wrote that, “There are so many rivals in Painting, that if our friend Russel can get the English at Rome as sole <em>cicerone</em>, it may possibly prove the more beneficial profession.”<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup> Indeed, Russel’s work as a tour guide ultimately took precedence over his artistic pursuits.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes <em>ciceroni</em> traveled with their clients, but they might have found it more lucrative to remain at the site of business. <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morison</a>, for example, accompanied <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1718\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Ogilvy, 7th and 4th Earl of Findlater and Seafield</a> (1750-1811, travel years 1771-1773), in Europe and northern Italy but charged him £600 to make up for income he forfeited by leaving Rome. Roman <em>ciceroni</em> did, however, lead tours in nearby towns with popular sights: for instance, in 1777 <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Byres</a> guided a party of three in Tivoli, Albani, and Frascati (see Appendix). Other kinds of work that <em>ciceroni</em> did, such as writing guidebooks, making copies, and collecting and dealing, including procuring export licenses, also participated in the economy of the Grand Tour.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Travelers, for their part, came to expect these services, while guides profited, sometimes shamelessly, through duplicitous or shady practices. <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2680\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jenkins</a> (1722-1798, travel 1751-1798), for example, would overcharge unwitting clients and pass off modern objects made under his supervision, such as cameos, as antiques.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> Others bought artworks, either ancient or modern, and arranged for them to be exported without procuring the requisite licenses from the papal antiquarian, who controlled their issuance.<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup> <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a>, for instance, secretly negotiated for the Bonapaduli family to sell their coveted series of paintings of the seven sacraments by the great seventeenth-century French artist Nicolas Poussin to the Duke of Rutland.<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> These celebrated pictures were such a tourist attraction, however, that they were replaced with copies, which Byres then passed off as the originals. Similarly, Ficoroni failed to inform the papal antiquarian of a work he had acquired through an excavation, an antique head of porphyry that he had bought “from certain masons who had found it in a dig,” and was put on trial and fined.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Clients</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> was essential to identifying the clients of <em>ciceroni</em>, as many as 142 (see <a href=\"#figure-1\">Figure 1</a>).

Other travelers who toured with <em>ciceroni</em> were identified in the <em>Explorer</em>, but because their guides were not named they don’t appear on the client list. As would be expected, the information in the <em>Explorer</em> was fullest for British clients. However, no clients were found for Venuti, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3732\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Parker</a>, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3049\" target=\"\\_blank\">Andrew Lumisden</a> (1720-1801, travel years 1749-1769), <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3769\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Patoun</a> (fl. 1761-d. 1783, travel years 1761-1763, 1763-1764, 1768-1769, 1773-1774, 1775-1776), or <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2065\" target=\"\\_blank\">Abbé Peter Grant</a> (1708-1784, travel years 1726-1735, 1737-1784), even though the last, a Jesuit priest and antiquarian, was regarded as “something of an institution” among Grand Tourists. Patoun seems to have worked more as a bear leader than a <em>cicerone</em>; a few of his charges appear in the <em>Explorer</em>. In 1775 he accompanied one of them, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3957\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis</a>, on a tour conducted by <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Byres</a>.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> It is hard—maybe impossible—to know how many more travelers than those I identified were guided by <em>ciceroni</em>, which should be kept in mind in considering the information presented here.</p>\n\n<p>Most of Ficoroni’s clients, whom he listed in his own publication, appear in the <em>Explorer</em>.

The aristocratic British writer <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4974\" target=\"\\_blank\">Horace Walpole</a> (1717-1797, travel years 1739-1741) famously described the Dilettanti as “…a club, for which the nominal qualification is having been in Italy and the real one being drunk; the two chiefs are <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3305\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lord Middlesex</a> and Sir Francis Dashwood, who were seldom sober the whole time they were in Italy.”<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup> Nonetheless, the Dilettanti made significant cultural contributions later in the century.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> Touring with Dashwood and Rawdon was <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3552\" target=\"\\_blank\">Roger Newdigate</a> (1719-1806, travel years 1739-1740, 1774-1775), a draughtsman and amateur architect who wrote an important account of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence during his travels.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> Among Mark Parker’s clients was also <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3919.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Henrietta Louisa Fermor, Countess of Pomfret</a> (c. 1700-1761, travel years 1739-1741), the first woman we know to have toured with a <em>cicerone</em>.</p>\n\n<p>A number of <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4179\" target=\"\\_blank\">Russel</a>’s clients appear in the <em>Explorer</em>, too, as well as the brothers <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/859\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lord George Augustus Cavendish</a> (c. 1727-1794, travel years 1749-1750) and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/858\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lord Frederick Cavendish</a> (1729-1803, travel years 1749-1750), who were forced to cancel their tour at the last minute after the tutor accompanying them, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3033\" target=\"\\_blank\">Dr. Robert Lowth</a> (1710-1787, travel years 1749-1750), spilled scalding water on his leg and was incapacitated for six weeks. The <em>Explorer</em> also reveals that <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/952\" target=\"\\_blank\">Clark</a>, the major <em>cicerone</em> of Naples, sometimes served as a guide for the same clients led by <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morison</a> (<a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3935\" target=\"\\_blank\">Porter</a> and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4163\" target=\"\\_blank\">Rowley</a>) or <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a> (<a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/611\" target=\"\\_blank\">Brooke</a> and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3741\" target=\"\\_blank\">Parkinson</a>, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2121\" target=\"\\_blank\">Egerton</a> and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1823\" target=\"\\_blank\">Foxley</a>) in Rome, supporting the notion that <em>ciceroni</em> tended to establish their businesses in particular cities and stay there. However, I found only one traveler who toured with two different <em>ciceroni</em> in the same city: in Rome, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/324\" target=\"\\_blank\">Elizabeth Berkeley, Duchess of Beaufort</a> (1719-1799, travel years 1771-1774), visited the Colonna Palace with <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2680\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jenkins</a> in 1773 and St. Peter’s Basilica with Byres in 1774.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> confirms that <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morison</a> and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a> were two of the most popular guides of their day. Nonetheless, one <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/553\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Brand</a> (c. 1717-1770, travel years 1738-1739, 1754-1755) commented that Morison and his client, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1159\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Coussmaker</a> (1759-1802, travel years 1783-1784), “were like ‘a hen with a single chicken,’ while James Byres escorted a party of seven at the same time.” Indeed, Byres had by far the most clients on my list—forty-nine, including a party of seven in 1784—while Morison is most well known as the <em>cicerone</em> of <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/509\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Boswell</a> (1740-1795, travel year 1765), biographer of the writer Samuel Johnson. Capitalizing on their positions, Morison and Byres sometimes acted as agents or dealers for those they guided, Morison for <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2445\" target=\"\\_blank\">Richard Colt Hoare</a> (1758-1838, travel years 1785-1787, 1788-1791) and Byres for <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5279\" target=\"\\_blank\">Philip Yorke</a> (1757-1834, travel years 1778-1779), but clients of one <em>cicerone</em> sometimes used another for that purpose, too.</p>\n\n<p>What can be gleaned from the biographical information for clients derived from the <em>Explorer</em> (see <a href=\"#figure-2\">Figure 2</a>)? To begin with professions, including future careers, we can see that statesmen top the list by more than thirty, with writers and scholars together and military officers second and third. As for university, the largest number of clients went to Oxford, then to Cambridge by little more than half the amount, with Eton and Westminster the most popular schools. My survey of groups, women, and families indicates that a number of clients toured together. Clients toured with traveling companions, bear leaders, tutors, governors, their families, and were occasionally paired with strangers. I was not surprised to find that a large number of clients were titled or royal, though less than half of all, but did expect there to be more Catholics, the church and its art and architecture being one of the major attractions of travel to Italy.</p>\n\n<p>I was a bit surprised that so few of the clients I tracked became members of learned societies, especially the Dilettanti, the existence of which was predicated on the Grand Tour. Nor did many clients become important patrons of the arts like <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3013\" target=\"\\_blank\">Charles Long</a> (1760-1838, travel years 1786-1788), who was a trustee of both the British Museum and the National Gallery, or <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3919.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lady Pomfret</a>, who donated a collection of ancient sculpture to the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> However, some American colonists guided by <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a> returned to play significant roles in their fledgling country.<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup> Two were prominent Philadelphians and two were from Boston; on their tour in 1764 they probably would have considered themselves to be Britons. Three proved loyal to the colonies; only one, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3714\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Palmer</a> (1743-1820, travel year 1764), left America in 1776. <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3429\" target=\"\\_blank\">Dr. John Morgan</a> (1735-1789, travel year 1764), a prominent physician, returned to Philadelphia to found the American Philosophical Society and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3953\" target=\"\\_blank\">Samuel Powel</a> (d. 1793, travel year 1764), both the last colonial and the first post-colonial mayor of Philadelphia, joined the society.</p>\n\n<p>My client list mentions a few travelers who guided their companions, but were not themselves professional <em>ciceroni</em>, such as <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2437\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Coxe Hippisley</a> (1747-1825, travel years 1799-1780, 1793-1795, 1818), later a baronet, who guided <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2363\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Augustus Herbert, Lord Herbert</a> (1759-1827, travel years 1779-1780), in Rome in 1779, though Herbert had engaged <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/952\" target=\"\\_blank\">Clark</a> in Naples. Some artists and scholars took visitors sightseeing on occasion. The painter and antiquarian <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2207\" target=\"\\_blank\">Gavin Hamilton</a> (1723-1798, travel years 1748-1750, 1756-1798), for example, led a party of tourists to see his excavations at the site of the ancient city of Gabii, outside of Rome.<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> Similarly, the great German writer Johann Wolfgang Goethe noted in his Grand Tour journal that his countryman, Johann Friedrich Reiffenstein, an antiquarian and artist who lived in Rome, sometimes showed visitors around the city and planned activities for them.<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> also references <em>ciceroni</em> other than those on my list, but most are otherwise unknown, even if named. Among those named are Britons and a few Italians, some of whom worked in cities other than Rome and Naples: a Pietro Paolo Pizoli in Bologna and an Abbé Pilori in Florence. Clients’ comments make clear that elite <em>ciceroni</em> were in competition with shady or less qualified ones. <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2363\" target=\"\\_blank\">Herbert</a> noted that one Raphaeli, a <em>cicerone</em> in Naples, stole things. According to Johann Jakob Volkmann, a well-educated German who toured with Winckelmann, “Most of these antiquaries are abbots [abate was an honorific title for a cassock-clad layman] who work in the field as manual laborers. Without possessing science or taste, they learn their routine by heart…baptize the statues according to their will, and give false names to the pictures. Most of the pieces are called cose stupende [stupendous things] with no discrimination, but they can very seldom conduct the art lover to true beauty and to the building of his taste,” which was Winckelmann’s goal.<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup> Similarly, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/167\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Edward Ayscough</a> (d. 1779, travel year 1770), a soldier and dramatist, described the <em>ciceroni</em> of Rome as “a set of scurvy abbati’s to whom foreigners pay a settled salary, and give constant place at their table, to be led about like bears by these learned [his italics] gentlemen…whose interest it is never to let him leave Rome while he can show him a broken pillar, a mutilated statue, or a single classical vestige of any kind whatever.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Tours</strong></p>\n\n<p>What were the tours led by elite <em>ciceroni</em> like and what were their clients’ experiences? By the late eighteenth century these tours must have been fairly standardized, though my research confirmed that they could vary in length, the sights that were seen, and the amount of time spent touring each day. <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3413\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Moore</a> (1729-1802, travel years 1775-1776), a physician and writer who visited Rome in 1775-76 in the company of <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2203\" target=\"\\_blank\">Douglas Hamilton, the 8th Duke of Hamilton</a> (1756-1799, travel years 1775-1776), described his tour in the account he wrote of his travels. “What is called a regular course with an Antiquarian, generally takes up about six weeks; employing three hours a day, you may, in that time, visit all the churches, palaces, villas, and ruins worth seeing, in or near Rome….[T]here are about thirty palaces in Rome, as full of pictures as the walls can bear…There are also ten or twelve villas in the neighborhood of this city, which are usually visited by strangers.”<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup>  Winckelmann’s excursions reportedly lasted more than three hours a day, extending from nine in the morning until three or four in the afternoon.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a> and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morison</a> expected twenty sequins (<em>zecchini</em>) for a course, “and thirty if two companions.”<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup> When Byres’ handed his business over to Moir, however, the uncle advised his nephew to charge £50 or £100 per person, and recommended that parties should comprise “five or not more than seven.” He further noted that select travelers should be entertained with “a Hansom Breakfast, Dinner or Supper.” According to <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3769\" target=\"\\_blank\">Patoun</a>, <em>ciceroni</em>, not their clients, should also pay “the servants who shew the palaces.”<sup id=\"fnref:40\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></sup> He suggested 3 pauls for a small palace, 5 for a larger one, and half a sequin for the Colonna and Barberini palaces. Who were the servants to whom Patoun was referring? Did they give tours of the palaces or merely provide access? One possibility is that they were high-ranking servants who cared for the household property of elites, some of whom acted as advisers, agents, or curators for their employers’ collections.<sup id=\"fnref:41\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In preparation for touring, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3769\" target=\"\\_blank\">Patoun</a> advised travelers to read Venuti’s guidebook to Roman antiquities, recommending “the Night before the Chapter…that describes the quarter or particular Piece of Antiquity which you are to see with your Antiquarian the day following. By this means you will go informed to a great degree, and of course perceive clearer Ideas, and be more able to make proper questions, when any doubt arises.”<sup id=\"fnref:42\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></sup> Similarly, Winckelmann noted that tourists were ill prepared for sightseeing and planned to write a guidebook for Germans to read before departing their homeland.<sup id=\"fnref:43\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The quality of the tour would have depended of course upon the quality of the guide. As has been suggested, many tours were probably not like those given by the elite <em>ciceroni</em> on my list. Moreover, there is not a great deal of information on the more elite tours and the relative merits of their guides, and some of it is contradictory. <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3769\" target=\"\\_blank\">Patoun</a> said that “Morisson is esteemed the best Medallist &amp; Classic Scholar, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a> the most agreable &amp; communicative….They are both Originally Painters, and of course know the Pictures as well as the Antiquities,” which was an important qualification. “Having a regard for both, I cannot recommend one in preference to the other.”<sup id=\"fnref:44\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></sup> However, clients complained that both these <em>ciceroni</em> were given to moodiness and pedantry.<sup id=\"fnref:45\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>More seems to be known about <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a>’ tours than those of others, thanks to the survival of descriptions by clients. Apparently Byres had no fixed itinerary, but determined his course by the weather, “antiquities and ruins when fine, statues and palaces when wet,” and pictures on clear but unpleasantly windy days. Two of his clients mentioned above, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3953\" target=\"\\_blank\">Powel</a> and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3429\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morgan</a>, took a three-week course with Byres in the spring of 1764 (the recommended season) and kept notes on what they saw in Rome.<sup id=\"fnref:46\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></sup> Most such courses began with a visit to the Capitoline Hill, as did <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/509\" target=\"\\_blank\">Boswell</a>’s tour with <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morison</a>; there the <em>cicerone</em> would point out the seven hills and principal sights of antiquity.<sup id=\"fnref:47\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></sup> Powel and Morgan, however, started with the Vatican Palace and St. Peter’s Basilica, spending four days there in all. During the rest of the week they visited the Villa Farnesina and the Palazzo Farnese as well as other palaces. They also heard a papal mass at the Oratorian church of S. Maria in Vallicella, called the Chiesa Nuova (new church).</p>\n\n<p>In the second week of their tour, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3953\" target=\"\\_blank\">Powel</a> and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3429\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morgan</a> focused on seeing collections in palaces and stopped in various churches along their way. On the weekend they visited the Capitoline Hill and its buildings, including the museum, the basilica of S. Paolo Fuori le Mura (St. Paul Outside the Walls), and the Villa Albani. The final week of Powel and Morgan’s tour began with a trip to the Colosseum and included the Baths of Titus and Trajan, more palaces, and the Villa Borghese. On the last day they were “presented to His Holiness.” This course seems to have been somewhat light on the antiquities—they didn’t go to the forum, for instance—which may have reflected the weather conditions or the preferences of the clients, as their tour was rather short.</p>\n\n<p>In educating his charges, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a> displayed his antiquarian and connoisseurial skills, explaining the historical and literary contexts of ancient monuments and sites and appraising the quality of both antiquities and early modern paintings, as was appropriate to the understanding of these works in the eighteenth century. Although his courses were sometimes described as dry or dull, he would interject amusing anecdotes. For example, Byres told <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3953\" target=\"\\_blank\">Powel</a> and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3429\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morgan</a> that the bare-shouldered figure of “Justice” (actually Truth) on Gianlorenzo Bernini’s tomb of Alexander the VII in St. Peter’s was “so admirable that it caused a Workman to attempt to enjoy her, after which the Pope caused a Drapery of Brass to be put over the Body.”<sup id=\"fnref:48\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:48\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></sup> The story is apocryphal, of course, but it points up Byres’ classicizing taste and demonstrates how <em>cicerone</em> could mediate their clients’ experiences through their own preferences. If Byres disliked Bernini’s unrestrained baroque style, he might have objected even more to Caravaggio’s unidealized naturalism, for he didn’t even show his clients the artist’s great paintings of St. Matthew in the Contarelli chapel when they visited the church of S. Luigi dei Francesi.<sup id=\"fnref:49\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:49\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></sup> Byres’ taste may have been influenced by that of Mengs, his teacher, but even Mengs was less rigid; the <em>cicerone</em>’s preferences rather harken back to the strict standards espoused by the antiquarian and critic Giovanni Pietro Bellori in the later seventeenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:50\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:50\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">50</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Winckelmann shared <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a>’ neoclassical taste, though his tours were reportedly livelier. Volkmann, who visited the Vatican Palace with Winckelmann, described the reaction to his <em>cicerone</em>’s enthusiastic commentaries: “The papal guards stood there with open mouths completely astonished and maybe thought that malaria had disturbed his brains.”<sup id=\"fnref:51\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:51\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></sup> Winckelmann had been reading to Volkmann from his manuscripts on some of the antiquities, such as the <em>Apollo Belvedere</em>. His comments must been like the rhapsodic passage on that statue in one of his later publications: “My chest seems to expand with veneration and to heave like those I have seen swollen as if by the spirit of prophecy, and I feel myself transported to Delos and to the Lycian groves, places Apollo honored with his presence.”<sup id=\"fnref:52\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Winckelmann’s dramatic responses to ancient statuary, which he hoped to cultivate in others, seem to have remained unique among <em>ciceroni</em> but not tourists. Roman antiquities had sparked the imaginations of travelers long before the eighteenth century; the reactions of Grand Tourists, especially Britons, are particularly distinguished by their excited visualizations of the distant past. Educated in the classics, many of these travelers were routinely prompted by the material remains of antiquity to imagine the ancient world, enthusiastically reconstructing it in their minds through historical and literary association.<sup id=\"fnref:53\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:53\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></sup> Indeed, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3049\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lumisden</a> noted in the guide he wrote to Rome that, “…on the spot we read them [the classics] with an additional enthusiasm,…”<sup id=\"fnref:54\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:54\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">54</a></sup> Thus the historian <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1935\" target=\"\\_blank\">Edward Gibbon</a> (1737-1794, travel years 1764-1765) recalled the beginning of his Roman tour with <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a>, which inspired him to write his famous history of Rome:</p>\n\n<blockquote>My temper is not very susceptible of enthusiasm, and the enthusiasm which I do not feel I have ever scorned to affect. But at the distance of twenty-five years, I can neither forget nor express the strong emotions which agitated my mind as I first approached and entered the <i>eternal City</i>. After a sleepless night, I trod, with a lofty step, the ruins of the Forum; each memorable spot where Romulus <i>stood</i>, or Tully spoke, or Caesar fell, was at once present to my eye; and several days of intoxication were lost or enjoyed before I could descend to a cool and minute investigation.<span><sup id=\"fnref:55\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:55\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">55</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, when <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/509\" target=\"\\_blank\">Boswell</a> visited the Palatine hill with <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morison</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>We walked to where the house of Cicero had stood. A statue there resembles him a great deal. Struck by these famous places, I was seized with enthusiasm. I began to speak Latin. Mr. Morison replied. He laughed a bit at the beginning. But we made a resolution to speak Latin continually during this course of antiquities. We have persisted, and every day we speak with greater facility, so that we have harangued on Roman antiquities in the language of the Romans themselves.<span><sup id=\"fnref:56\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:56\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">56</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>Despite its playfulness, this episode illustrates the imaginative depth of the experience possible for tourists, even if <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/509\" target=\"\\_blank\">Boswell</a> had to lead his <em>cicerone</em>. Nonetheless, the professional guide—however changed since the eighteenth century—has become a fixture of modern travel, and that is the undeniable legacy of the <em>ciceroni</em> of the Grand Tour.</p>\n\n<h3>References</h3>\n\n<div class=\"overlay\" id=\"popup\" style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column; flex-wrap: wrap; background: #f7f6f3\">\n    <div id=\"imgs\" style=\"height:80%\">\n        <div class=\"overlay-close\">\n            <a><i class=\"material-icons\">close</i></a>\n        </div>\n        <img id=\"img\" />\n        <img id=\"img2\" />\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"capWrapper\" style=\"height:20%\">\n        <p id=\"cap\" style=\"float:left; max-width:80%; position:relative; left:120px; display:inline-block\"></p>\n        <div style=\"display:inline-block; float: right\">\n            <div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column; position:relative; right:100px; top:20px\">\n                <i class=\"material-icons link-cite\" aria-label=\"Cite this image\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">format_quote</i>\n                <i class=\"material-icons link-copy\" aria-label=\"Copy link to this image\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">link</i>\n                <i class=\"material-icons\" aria-label=\"Download\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">arrow_downward</i>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nfunction zoom(obj, obj2, caption) {\n    var popup = document.getElementById(\"popup\");\n    popup.style.maxHeight = \"90%\";\n    popup.style.height = \"90%\"\n    var image = document.getElementById(\"img\");\n    var image2 = document.getElementById(\"img2\");\n        \n    image.src = obj.src;\n    image.style.display = \"block\";\n    image.style.marginLeft = \"auto\";\n    image.style.marginRight = \"auto\";\n    image.style.left = \"0\";\n    image.style.right = \"0\";\n    image.style.width = \"100%\";\n    image.style.height = \"100%\";\n    image.style.objectFit = \"contain\";\n\n    image2.style.display = \"none\"; // hide in case Fig 1 or 2 were clicked\n    document.getElementById(\"capWrapper\").style.width = image.offsetWidth;\n\n    if (obj2 != undefined && obj2 != null) { // Figure 1 & 2 are paired\n        image.style.float = \"left\";\n        image.style.width = \"50%\";\n\n        image2.src = obj2.src;\n        \n        image2.style.display = \"block\";\n        image2.style.marginLeft = \"auto\";\n        image2.style.marginRight = \"auto\";\n        image2.style.left = \"0\";\n        image2.style.right = \"0\";\n        image2.style.float = \"left\";\n        image2.style.width = \"50%\";\n        image2.style.height = \"100%\";\n        image2.style.objectFit = \"contain\";\n\n        document.getElementById(\"capWrapper\").style.width = image.offsetWidth + image2.offsetWidth; \n    }\n    var cap = document.getElementById(\"cap\");\n    if (caption != undefined && caption != null) {\n        cap.innerHTML = caption.innerHTML;\n        cap.style.display = \"block\";\n        cap.style.marginTop = \"20px\";\n    } else {\n        cap.style.display = \"none\";\n    }\n    var overlays = document.getElementsByClassName(\"overlay\");\n      for (overlay of overlays) {\n        overlay.classList.remove(\"visible\");\n      }\n    popup.classList.add(\"visible\"); \n}    \n</script>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>John Evelyn, <em>The Diary of John Evelyn</em>, edited by Esmond Samuel de Beer, 6 vols.

        "content"  : "<p>My interest in the Grand Tour explorer arises out of my own work on the engagement of British travelers with Italian cities during the long eighteenth century. Some years ago, I published a book that concentrated upon British experiences and representations of Italian cities during the long eighteenth century, Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c. 1690-1820.1 As an urban historian, I was less concerned with what was collected or purchased by travelers, or with their social networks, than with exploring how images of major Italian cities were constructed and considering their influence in British culture. Given the opportunity to work with the Grand Tour Explorer, I wanted to use it to pursue several questions.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Like many historians, years of immersion in the primary sources meant that I had an intuitive sense of evolving patterns of travel and the composition of the traveling body. However, I was unable to provide any rigorous quantifiable basis for my conclusions or generalizations. How far were my generalizations borne out by the evidence of the Explorer, while taking into account the complex nature of its data, which we know to be far from complete (see the introduction of the book)? What new light could the Explorer cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the Explorer tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body? The dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste, acquired and polished in Italy, exercised such a powerful influence upon Britain’s eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.2 But it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic grand tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out throughout my book was the increasing presence of both female travelers and travelers from beyond the landed elite over the course of the eighteenth century, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book: Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile: such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa and Leghorn.</p>\n"

Tolkien’s <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, “not all those who wander are lost.”<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Indeed, as the recent brouhaha over the “wanderlust gene” DRD4-7R testifies, travel is a constant of human experience inflected in myriad ways by history, literature, and life; from the Aboriginal Walkabout and the Homeric epics through the Jungian archetype of “the wanderer” to <em>Tripadvisor.com</em> and Ibiza stag parties.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>  People travel to eat, to learn, and to conquer. They travel in search of architectural inspiration, for reasons of health, and simply because destinations were “there,” in Edmund Hillary’s felicitous formulation. Within this swath of human history my interest lies with a particular <em>kind</em> of purposeful travel that I would define as “economic.” By this I do not mean frugal or “low cost,” or for that matter more permanent migration in search of a livelihood, but travel for the purpose of improving the management of the material world—theoretically or practically, individually or collectively; more the Jesuit François Xavier d’Entrecolles discovering the secrets of Chinese porcelain in 1712 than, say, Ryanair.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> Economic journeys are, by default, emulative in aspiration if not in practice, as they are driven by the desire to discover better ways of doing and thinking in the economic sphere—not to mention to establish commercial linkages and networks. Such travels represent a crucial vector of globalization both past and present.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In the wake of East Timor’s new independence in 2002, for example, future Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri embarked on a global tour of “relevant” countries, ranging from Singapore to Nauru to Norway, in order to “learn from their experiences” and choose which one to emulate as a model of national political economy.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> A decade later, the Wenzhou businessman Sun Jian decided to fly to Lagos, Nigeria, after having considered everything from Bangladesh to Uzbekistan, because he had heard of opportunities there for outsourcing of Chinese manufacturing.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> These leaders’ modes of travel, one informed by macro- and the other by micro-economic concerns, harken back to the origins of international commerce and communication itself; to the conceptual beginnings of what we today call globalization.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> Examples of such economic tours are bountiful, stretching back into the dimmest eons of recorded history; eighteenth-century Europe positively brimmed with them.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> Indeed, the mythical “Grand Tour” in early modern Europe, of which these forms of instructive travel represent a woefully neglected aspect, has come to be seen as one of the cardinal institutions of the Enlightenment.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Scholars have recently called for a broader analysis of the Grand Tour, including, among other things, the women and children, servants and middlemen, foreigners and Italians among whom wealthy young Britons travelled. Though I am principally interested in the role of travel in early modern political economy, this essay contributes to expanding the historical parameters of Grand Tourism.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> I have elsewhere explored how the theories and practices of countries that “forged ahead,” to quote the Stanford economist Moses Abramowitz, were emulated in Europe through the medium of translation. Relatedly, I would argue that another type of “Grand Tour” emerged in the eighteenth century, in which travelers visited countries of similar or more advanced economic development and geopolitical standing for both technological and governmental inspiration. To emulate, in short, foreign best practices.<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup> The exercise of collecting strategic intelligence abroad had, of course, been a primary task of spies and ambassadors in early modern Europe, but a broader and more diverse set of travelers came to carry out this activity over the course of the eighteenth century. As the statesman, intellectual, and future 117th Doge of Venice Marco Foscarini put it in a 1742 ambassadorial report from Turin, one of the primary purpose of such accounts had historically been not merely to record events, but to survey the trade networks, industries, and armies of different countries. Yet,</p>\n\n<blockquote>…as these became familiar with the passing of time, and common knowledge because of the new facility of travel, which rendered it more frequent, and because of the infinite number of published books comprehensively treating of these issues, one has, not without reason, abandoned this form of report over the past century and reduced it to a kind of particular history containing the maxims, councils, and arcane origins of the things that took place during the duration of any given Ambassadorship. <span><sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>The increasing frequency of travel, along with the exploding volume of publications in early modern Europe, changed the economy of intelligence on the continent, as a far wider spectrum of travelers and thinkers turned to questions of political economy and accumulated insights became common knowledge.<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup> Yet Foscarini insisted that travel could still offer strategic insights into the economic administration and economic systems of competing polities, even offering “perfect examples to imitate.”<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> Like textual translation, travel thus remained one of the early modern period’s principal vehicles of both international emulation and the standardization of best practices in the Western world, not to mention, in some cases, its transoceanic connections.<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> “The subject of Finances,” the future U.S. President John Adams mused, could be learned only “from books or from Travel.”<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup> For similar reasons, his fellow Founder and future President <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2667\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jefferson</a> (1743-1826, travel year 1787) visited Piedmont in 1787 as part of his Grand Tour to study rice-growing practices. Like many contemporary traveling collectors, Jefferson acquired rare books in Italy, including a “copy of Polybius, the best edition,” but he readily admitted that</p>\n\n<blockquote>I scarcely got into classical ground… in architecture, painting, sculpture, I found much amusement; but more than all in their agriculture, many objects of which might be adopted with us to great advantage. <span><sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>Though <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2667\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jefferson</a> indulged in many of the activities of the stereotypical Grand Tourist, his itinerary was fundamentally inflected by exigencies of political economy.</p>\n\n<p>Macro- and micro-economic interests sometimes overlapped during what one might call “Economic Grand Tours,” as was the case when the Milanese merchant and large-scale textile manufacturer Antonio Greppi traveled most of Europe not merely in search of business opportunities, but to familiarize himself with the theoretical study of international political economy.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup> Direct experience lent authority in economic affairs, as the Abruzzo adventurer Troiano Odazi proved when he successfully advertised his extensive travels when seeking a professorship in political economy at the University of Naples.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup> The Germanic ideal of <em>Bildung</em> so essential to the Grand Tour was, after all, pursued for individual as well as societal ends.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> Even the aesthetic language that Grand Tourists habitually employed to describe sublime vistas of Roman ruins and bucolic bliss found economic expression in some cases. When the Milanese patrician and scholar Alessandro Verri first visited England, for example, he marveled at the <em>bellissima veduta</em> not of Dover’s white cliffs but rather of London along the banks of the Thames, “covered with merchant ships, which form a forest of trees and another city on the sea.”<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> provides a remarkable tool for considering the continental experiences of travelers from what was by many accounts the world’s most advanced economy, Britain, as they ventured to Italy, a one-time seat of commercial power in Europe then in relative decline.<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> And yet, while the <em>Explorer</em> helps visualize and analyze the British Grand Tour to Italy in new ways, it also exemplifies some of the pitfalls of applying digital tools in the humanities. By mentioning this I do not intend to diminish the value of such scholarship, but rather to contribute to furthering the ways in which old scholarship and new technologies can interact and such digital projects can truly benefit the humanities.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> retains many of the cornucopian qualities of its source, <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy 1701-1800</em> (1997). The latter was the work of a large editorial team led by John Ingamells in order to engage with the vast personal archive of the British collector and art historian Sir Brinsley Ford.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup> The project of amassing the <em>Dictionary</em> was by necessity eclectic, even quixotic, but produced a unique treasure trove of information regarding the British Grand Tour to Italy in the age of Enlightenment; or, perhaps more appropriately, of contemporary British, Irish, and American travel to Italy. British visitors to Italy might or might not have made the list, depending on availability and convenience of materials, not to mention personal interest. They might be blessed with pages of text or relegated to cursory sentences (though it needs to be said that the <em>Dictionary</em> identified a <em>very</em> large number of even cursory travelers). Needless to say, the editorial team only recorded itineraries of which they were certain. This led to a number of travelers “teleporting” around Italy as evidenced through fleeting appearances of names and places in archival or published sources. No Grand Tourist could <em>only</em> have visited landlocked Florence in the eighteenth century, no matter how attractive its institutional reforms and relative development were to contemporary travelers.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> It might even be argued that the <em>Dictionary</em> could only be so rich and varied because of what it neglected. As Orlando Pescetti put it in his <em>Proverbi italiani</em>, rendered famous by Voltaire, “the best is the enemy of the good.”<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> In this, the <em>Explorer</em> has walked a fine line, maintaining the <em>Dictionary</em>’s original underlying structures, while also making them more transparent and increasing accessibility to its rich content.</p>\n\n<p>Ford, Ingamells, and their collaborators did <em>not</em> plan on their work being transformed into an easily accessible database. This is clear when considering, for example, the defining terms with which many of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entries begin, which the <em>Explorer</em> has organized in the category of “Employments and Identifiers.” Perhaps only a lone British “editor of Shakespeare” and a solitary “bear-leader” really ventured to Italian shores in the eighteenth century—though if one were to substitute “bear-leader” with the term “tutor” or “traveling tutor” the number swells to four—but it is hard to believe that only one solitary traveler was a “dilettante poet,” one an “amateur scientist,” and only one, rather implausibly, warranted the qualifier “miscreant.”<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> Ingamells cared first and foremost (one is tempted to say singularly) about what Ford had called “matters connected with the arts, patronage [and] collecting,” yet he called only one lonely voyager an “art critic”; boding poorly for subjects he cared for not at all.<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> Similarly, though focusing on British travelers, even for the period following the War of Independence (1775-1783), he continued to list several Americans. And can we really be certain that <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/508\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Bosville</a> (1745-1813, travel year 1779) was the British Grand Tour’s <em>only</em> “bon vivant,” and <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4536\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Hall Stevenson</a> (1718-85, travel year 1753) its token “hedonist,” rather than the other way around?<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup> The <em>Explorer</em> illustrates how the <em>Dictionary</em>’s categories were literary in many cases rather than simply analytical. It also shows how, in extrapolating data from a different medium, one risks codifying the tentative and impressionistic. Ingamells, after all, wished for the book to be “readable” and—somewhat lethally for an analytical database—to embrace “a certain variety of style.”<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup> To a scholar of the Grand Tour, the classification of the physician and tour-guide <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2321\" target=\"\\_blank\">Dr. James Hay</a> (d. 1746, travel years 1704-1706, 1707-1709, 1711-1712, 1715, 1718-1719, 1720, 1722-1723, 1729-1734) as “bear-leader,” for example, is a witty implicit reference to Pier Leone Ghezzi’s c. 1725 caricature “Dr. Hay as Bear-Leader” and the colloquial eighteenth-century nickname for a traveling tutor. But it also risks suggesting Hay was touring with actual bears—also an early modern practice—around the ruins of ancient Rome rather than wealthy British youths.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-1.png\" id=\"fig1\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1\">\n\n<b>Fig. 1:</b> Pier Leone Ghezzi, <i>Dr. Hay as Bear-Leader</i>, c. 1725, London, British Museum.

Moreover, the <em>Explorer</em> curates and adds new layers of navigation to the <em>Dictionary</em>’s text. The “Occupations and Posts” categories now group the professions and interests of travelers in more searchable forms. Still, as a digital transformation of the original text, the <em>Explorer</em>’s data remains, so far, largely dependent on the information contained in the <em>Dictionary</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, Ford, Ingamells, and their team <em>did</em> take note of merchants, to the extent that the second single largest category in “Employments and Identifiers” after “painter” (165 entries) is “merchant” (157 entries). And if one adds the sundry variations of the term—“textile merchant,” “timber merchant, “oriental merchant,” and “wine merchant”—as well as other “economic” occupations such as, in “Occupations and Posts,” “banker,” “merchant banker,” “financier,” and, of course, “money lender,” in this case the notorious <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2774\" target=\"\\_blank\">John “Jew” King</a> (1753-1823, travel years 1785-1823)—one can create a list of 180 such “economic” Grand Tourists reaching Italy from Britain during the period scrutinized by Ingamells; a similar number, incidentally, results from adding up the categories of “painter” (165), “portrait painter” (8), and “watercolourist” (4).<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> Both clusters are, in any case, limited compared to the 5,972 total entries in the <em>Explorer</em>, some of which were cross-referenced variations of names, but sizable in relation to the 914 travelers for whom Ingamells found “Employments and Identifiers,” or even the 2,020 that we end up with if we add those with identified “Occupations and Posts.” Adopting a bird’s eye view for the occasion, a map of all recorded travels of these individuals reveals a logical pattern.</p>\n\n<p>As a baseline of analysis, most Grand Tourists with an employment identifier, occupation or post visited Italian cities in the same order that the raw total did: Rome (1,371), distantly trailed by Florence (926) and Venice (812), then Naples (810), Turin (476), Leghorn (441), Padua (404), and Genoa (339), then a broad swath of locations from Trieste to Sicily. Many travelers reached Italy through France and the Alps, arriving at Turin in Savoy. Genoa and Leghorn’s prominent places in the second tier of cities might also reflect geographical necessities of travel at the time (for more on this, see Rachel Midura’s essay in this collection). One can only assume that Milan would have ranked higher in an aggregate map of Grand Tourists from Northern Europe, and Trieste would be ranked higher in the case of travelers from the East.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-2\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-2.png\" id=\"fig2\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap2&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap2\">\n\n<b>Fig. 2:</b> Travels of Grand Tourists with “Employment or Identifier” and/or “Occupations and Posts” information.

Unsurprisingly, Rome (158 travelers) remains the premier destination on the Grand Tour, with Florence a distant second (68). These are followed by Naples (63) and Venice (43), closely trailed by Bologna (31) and Parma (27). Only around a third of these travelers voyaged south of Rome, and, of these, even fewer outside of Naples, though it is remarkable that more visited Naples than Venice. Though this would require sustained archival work to ascertain, it is tempting to guess that the trips by this subset to many of the smaller cities reflected wishes to visit specific places of beauty or artworks on display. As William Hazlitt so famously, if wrong-headedly, derided his countrymen, “the English abroad turn out of their way to visit every pettifogging, huckstering object that they can see better at home…”<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-3.png\" id=\"fig3\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap3\">\n\n<b>Fig. 3:</b> Travels of Grand Tourists with “Painter,” “Portrait Painter” or “Watercolourist” as the “Employment or Identifier.” Travels tended to feature the major cities of the traditional Grand Tour, but show a wider distribution outside of them.

The Eternal City has, for the first time, been supplanted as the premier destination by Leghorn (98), followed by Naples (45), Venice (34), and Rome (31). Destinations further south were generally neglected by the itineraries of such “economic” Grand Tourists, who focused squarely on the country’s center and north, with comparably high frequencies of visits to the old economic core of the peninsula from Turin down to Genoa, and through Milan to Venice. Strikingly, these travelers were far less likely to be recorded in smaller cities on the Grand Tour than were artists. As the Danish Cameralist Peter Christian Schumacher, who explicitly had set out on a Grand Tour to study European practices of political economy, justified his decision not to visit Naples, “it holds so little influence in the European system that it cannot be of particularly dire importance [<em>magtpaaliggende</em>] what system they have.”<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-4.png\" id=\"fig4\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap4&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\n<b>Fig. 4:</b> Travels of “economic” grand tourists (180), with “Employment or Identifier” related to finance and trade.

The former city-states of Northern Italy continued to play a role in the commerce of the continent throughout the eighteenth century, and Leghorn remained an important <em>entrepôt</em> throughout the period, particularly for British interests due to the prevalence of the Levant Company. Frequently the first port of call after London for ships heading East, and a “great pivot” for British trade in the Mediterranean, Leghorn had long established itself as the main “funnel” for Turkish trade with Britain, France, and the Netherlands.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup> Leghorn held a unique place among Italian cities in the imagination of the Grand Tour for being clean, modern, and built for the living rather than the dead; a space of bustling trade rather than of towering ruins.<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup> Far more British merchants and sailors visited Leghorn than those identified in Ingamells’ <em>Dictionary</em>, of course (as observed by Simon Macdonald in this collection). But it remains interesting that the “Free Port” of Leghorn—recently the subject of long overdue scholarly attention in the English-speaking world—would play such an important role in the more traditional Grand Tour that was the primary focus of the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:40\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2984\" target=\"\\_blank\">Henry Lloyd</a>’s version of the Grand Tour was, in many ways, characteristic of this kind of economic travel. Very much confined to the upper half of the Italian peninsula, his journeys were dictated by his career as an international spy and economic theorist, as well as by his friendship with members of the Milanese “Academy of Fisticuffs” (<em>Accademia dei pugni</em>), with whom he revolutionized the use of algebra and differential calculus in political economy.<sup id=\"fnref:41\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></sup> Lloyd traveled for reasons of international power politics and to learn about the science and discipline of political economy—itself repeatedly declared emblematic of the Enlightenment as such.<sup id=\"fnref:42\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-5.png\" id=\"fig5\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap5&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap5\">\n\n<b>Fig. 5:</b> Comparison of recorded travels of <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2984\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Lloyd</a> (left, blue), <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/445\" target=\"_blank\">Sir Lambert Blackwell</a> (center, red) and <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/459\" target=\"_blank\">Lewis Blaquiere</a> (right, green).

Though hardly evocative of the Grand Tour as commonly understood, Ingamells’ fleeting and melancholy mention of <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/459\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lewis Blaquiere</a> (1722-1754, travel years 1744-1754) is also illustrative of countless other British merchants who escaped mention in the <em>Dictionary</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>BLAQUIERE, LEWIS (c.1722-54), merchant.<br />-1744-54 Leghorn.<br />With several other members of the British Factory at Leghorn, he signed a memorial in May 1744. He was presumably the Lewis Blaquiere who died in Leghorn on 3 August 1754, aged 32, and who was buried in the Protestant cemetery. <span><sup id=\"fnref:43\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/459\" target=\"\\_blank\">Blaquiere</a> came to Leghorn on business and died there a decade later. Predictably, the map of Blaquiere’s Grand Tour matches perfectly those of a number of alphabetized “merchant” entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>, all the way down to <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5243\" target=\"\\_blank\">Francis Wyatt</a> (travel year -1704), and presumably, numerous others.<sup id=\"fnref:44\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></sup> But, to quote my old friend U.S. Customs and Border Protection Declaration Form 6059B, “was the primary purpose of this trip business?”<sup id=\"fnref:45\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></sup> How relevant to the institution of the Grand Tour is Blaquiere’s resounding “yes” to this question? In the case of <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2667\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jefferson</a>, his travels were clearly driven by purposes of both business and pleasure, and the idea of an “Economic Grand Tour” thus makes a certain degree of sense, but Blaquiere?</p>\n\n<p>Accepting John Brewer’s basic ideal of the Grand Tour as “an educational rite of passage,” often in preparation of “public duties,” an employee on the job abroad such as <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/459\" target=\"\\_blank\">Blaquiere</a> may actually have had more in common with his contemporary <em>milordi Inglesi</em> than one might first think.<sup id=\"fnref:46\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></sup> For there existed a venerable European tradition of merchants and tradesmen undergoing similar rites of passage on the road to acquire status in their professions. The British merchant stationed in Leghorn might not ultimately have been that different from a pre-revolutionary French journeyman, a stereotypical Hanseatic apprentice stuck in Bergen for a decade before returning home to a more important desk job, or, for that matter, a noble Christ Church graduate preparing for a position in British government.<sup id=\"fnref:47\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></sup> Inflections of this practice—quintessentially evident even in the aforementioned Aboriginal Walkabout—continue to characterize modern business and government institutions alike in large parts of the world.</p>\n\n<p>If we focus instead on the subset of 37 Grand Tourists in the “Occupations and Posts” category of “Finance and Trade,” the resulting map presents a different picture.  This subset includes the sort of powerful economic actors whom contemporaries began to call “capitalists,” such as <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2850\" target=\"\\_blank\">David Digues La Touche</a> (1729-1817, travel years 1753-1754, 1781, 1787-1793), the first Governor of the Bank of Ireland. Among these tourists, Rome (19 travelers) reclaims its throne, followed by Venice (15), Florence (14), and Leghorn (11). Not surprisingly, those who <em>did</em> venture South of Italy’s financial centers did so for the reason one might expect from historiography. La Touche, for example, seemingly traveled to Capua and Naples as a “collector,” rather than on business.<sup id=\"fnref:48\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:48\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Turning to the larger occupational subset of “Statesmen and Political Appointees” (884), the resulting map is in turn more reminiscent of the pattern revealed by the overall <em>Explorer</em> data. It seems improbable that only <em>one</em> of these travelers visited Pompeii, but, generally speaking, these numbers highlight the degree to which recent scholarship has exaggerated the importance of Naples relative to northern Italian cities as a destination for British travelers, and even more egregiously so to the rest of southern Italy. It remains striking that, at the moment of writing, the search for “eighteenth-century Naples” has 574 hits on Google Scholar, vastly overshadowing the equivalent searches for Florence (149), Genoa (31), Milan (73), Livorno (47; Leghorn has 0), and Turin (82), though all are dwarfed by Venice (826) and particularly Rome (1,040). A more specific search for “Grand Tour” in conjunction with the names of various cities is less informative, simply because most works on the Grand Tour mention a host of names somewhere in their texts, but the difference between Naples (8,580) and Leghorn (973) still serves to illustrate the divergence between historical travel and historiographical emphasis.<sup id=\"fnref:49\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:49\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-6\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-6.png\" id=\"fig6\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig7&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap67&apos;))\" /> </a> <a name=\"figure-7\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-7.png\" id=\"fig7\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig6&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap67&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap67\">\n\n<b>Fig. 6 and 7:</b> Travels of Grand Tourists included in the “Finance and Trade” (left) and “Statesmen &amp; Political Appointees” (right) categories by the <i>Explorer</i> designers in the “Occupations and Posts” Group.

In the eighteenth century, English books mentioned Naples more frequently than English travelers actually visited the city, based on the <em>Explorer</em>, particularly in comparison to other cities. Leghorn was more important to English trade and travel than the aggregate book history as channeled by a Google Ngram would suggest. If nothing else, these different perspectives on the Grand Tour made possible by digital history suggest more expansive approaches to different cities than have been traditionally employed.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-9\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-9.png\" id=\"fig9\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig10&apos;),\n getElementById(&apos;cap910&apos;))\" />\n </a> <a name=\"figure-10\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-10.png\" id=\"fig10\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig9&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap910&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap910\">\n\n<b>Fig. 9 and 10:</b> Google Ngrams of mentions of select Italian cities in English publications, 1700-1800.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> supports the theory that economic travelers to Italy as a whole ventured to different places than those visited by the average traveler identified in the <em>Dictionary</em>, as well as those habitually emphasized by historians of the Grand Tour. Furthermore, it indicates a direction for more extensive archival work to answer the question of why, exactly, economically-interested individual British travelers chose particular destinations. Finally, the visualizations made possible by the use of digital tools suggest that significant historiographical revisionism is in order, as the center of gravity for British travelers to Italy matched the centers of economic activity on the peninsula far more closely than recent scholarship would suggest, even, as the aggregate data reveals, in the case of stereotypically aristocratic travelers seeking <em>Bildung</em> through exposure to the material remnants of antiquity.<sup id=\"fnref:52\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></sup> The Grand Tour was a protean institution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the shifting geography of which reflected changing spaces of cultural importance in Europe.<sup id=\"fnref:53\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:53\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></sup> Though the Enlightenment fervor for exoticism, antiquarianism, collecting, and bric-a-brac generally has been studied in recent decades, travel was also one of the most important vectors for worldlier processes of international commerce, communication, competition, and emulation at the time. The greatest difference between the traditional scholarly Grand Tour and its economic variation, however, might be that while the former looked to the past, the latter looked resolutely to the future, inventing rather than confirming established tropes.<sup id=\"fnref:54\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:54\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">54</a></sup> Journeying for business and political economy remains a vast, trans-historical phenomenon, of which the economic tourism traceable through the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> must be considered an important subset; the Grand Tour itself a particularly vibrant chapter in the timeless flow of goods, people, and ideas that forms our past and our present.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PK9HjOIVVbhW3W4EcCymgUUz-REeCKIZxa0oUJMr0NE/edit#gid=1084412681\" target=\"\\_blank\">Download and explore the data behind this essay.</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></p>\n\n<p>This paper was prepared as part of Giovanna Cesarani’s <em>Grand Tour Explorer Project</em>, and I am grateful to the participants at her Stanford conference of 4-5 March 2016 as well as to Steven L.

The 81 were identified by using the “Free word search” tool to locate entries containing “Rosalba” <i>or</i> “Carriera”. Close reading of the 81 entries was combined with information from additional sources to identify the types of association each traveler had with the artist, whether she appears in their correspondence or diaries, or they are known to have sat for a portrait by her or commissioned a piece of her artwork. The different types of association are indicated in different colors. This visualization gives a vivid impression of how many British travelers Carriera interacted with&#8212;and made portraits of&#8212;during her long career.

Her patrons included foreign collectors, artists, and members of the clergy, as well as fellow Venetians and other Italians. Royals across Europe sought her work: Frederick IV, King of Denmark; Johann Wilhelm von der Platz, Elector Palatine; and Frederick Augustus II, Prince-Elector of Saxony (also known as Augustus III, King of Poland), who amassed over one hundred pastels by Carriera for a gallery he dedicated to her in Dresden. Carriera’s studio, which she maintained in her home on the Grand Canal, was an important stop on the Grand Tour. Her clients sought portraits of themselves, depictions of various types of allegories, or portraits of Venetian women famous for their beauty or musical talent.<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-23\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sama-figure-23.png\" id=\"fig23\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap23&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap23\">\n\n<b>Figs. 2-3.

One of Carriera’s most ardent supporters was <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1035\" target=\"\\_blank\">Christian Cole</a> (fl. 1697-1735, travel years 1701-1705, 1707-1714, 1715), secretary to the <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3158\" target=\"\\_blank\">English Ambassador to Venice</a>. In a letter to the artist alerting her to the imminent arrival of <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1833\" target=\"\\_blank\">Sir Thomas Frankland</a> (c. 1683-1747, travel years 1704-1705), Cole noted that his compatriot, “would not like to pass through Venice without seeing the Signora Rosalba [who is] justly esteemed an ornament of Italy, and [the] premier painter of Europe.”<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> When traveling through Venice British travelers also acted as couriers for the artist, ferrying letters, books, pastel chalks and works of art between Carriera and other friends and acquaintances; among these individuals who populate the <em>Explorer</em>, we can count Cole, Frankland, and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4868\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Turner</a> (travel years 1704-1705). Still others—<a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2658\" target=\"\\_blank\">Peter Philip Jamineau</a> (travel years -1735-1745) and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4657\" target=\"\\_blank\">Owen Swiney</a> (1676-1754, travel years 1715-1732)—acted as agents for Carriera, negotiating commissions and arranging for payment and deliveries. In short, Carriera’s career was tightly bound to the transactional world of the Grand Tour, and British travelers collectively played a vital and multifaceted role in the artist’s work life.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>I came to the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> as a scholar of Rosalba Carriera, whose correspondence I am currently co-translating and editing.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> With few exceptions (including <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1035\" target=\"\\_blank\">Cole</a>), British clients and acquaintances are mostly absent from this correspondence. I wondered what further information the <em>Explorer</em> could offer about the artist and her interactions with these individuals, beyond the connections already widely established by art historians. This seemed a particularly intriguing question because, as an Italian artist, Rosalba Carriera does not have an entry in the richly detailed <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells (1997). Consequently, information about Carriera cannot be found in one easily identifiable place; instead, references to her appear scattered throughout the entries of the <em>Dictionary</em>. The search power of the <em>Explorer</em> made it easy to gather these references: one inquiry using the “Free word search” tool with the terms “Rosalba” or “Carriera” elicited 81 entries—a promising start to a more detailed investigation. I decided to explore the database in tandem with Carriera’s correspondence, her work diary, and other primary sources to confirm or clarify details about her British clients and to see if I could discover new information. Pairing primary sources with the database’s digital search capability was powerful: in some cases it allowed me to trace connections between Carriera and British clients even when neither Carriera nor Venice were mentioned in the <em>Explorer</em>’s entries. In others, unexpected aggregations of travelers in the search results produced new questions and ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Searches of the database using specific dates and places also help identify individuals whose names are illegible in manuscript sources. For example, on 9 May 1724 Carriera recorded in her work diary the visit to her studio of a “M.r Felo inglese” (<a href=\"#figure-3\">Figure 3</a>). A quick search of the <em>Explorer</em> using “Venice” and this specific date reveals that the British traveler <a href=\"http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1683\" target=\"\\_blank\">Coulson Fellowes</a> (1696-1769, travel year 1724), was in and around Venice at this time. Even though Carriera is not mentioned in Fellowes’ entry and despite the fact that his name is difficult to decipher in the primary source, we can confirm his identity. By perusing Ingamells’ <em>Dictionary</em> in print form, art historians have used this strategy to resolve questions about Fellowes and several other names in Carriera’s work diary.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> Anyone seeking to clarify such uncertainties can now do so much more easily using the database.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sama-figure-4.png\" id=\"fig4\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap4&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\n<b>Fig. 4:</b> Excerpt from Rosalba Carriera’s work diary, where she recorded the visits of visits to her studio. The entry for 9 May 1724 notes a visit from a “M.r Felo inglese.” By searching the <i>Explorer</i> for that date and “Venice” (the location of Carriera’s studio), it was possible to quickly identify the individual as Coulson Fellowes, a British Grand Tourist. The searchability of Grand Tour data enabled by the <i>Explorer</i> makes discoveries such as this much faster than before. Ashburnham 1781, 5, c. 62r.\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>In this essay I share my experience using the <em>Explorer</em> in order to investigate two specific aspects of Carriera’s life and work: first, her connections with other women, and second, her studio as a physical and social space. In so doing, I also aim to provide a vademecum of sorts for anyone wishing to navigate the expansive territories of the <em>Explorer</em>, particularly for those whose research focuses on the Italians or other Europeans with whom the British travelers interacted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rosalba Carriera</strong></p>\n\n<p>Little is known about Carriera’s early life and artistic training.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> Most women who became successful artists had fathers, brothers or husbands who were also artists. This was not the case for Carriera: her father worked as a government office clerk, she had no brothers, and she never married. She maintained her own studio where her sisters Giovanna and Angela (until the latter’s marriage) worked as assistants and collaborators. After their father’s death, Rosalba—aged 46—became the head of the family household, continuing to live with and support her mother and younger sister Giovanna for the rest of their lives.</p>\n\n<p>By her late twenties, the Venetian artist began to make a name for herself throughout Europe. She received invitations to courts across Europe and left the lagoon city for three extended trips. The most important of these was an invitation to Paris, where she lived for a year (1720-21) with her mother and sisters in the home of the financier and collector, Pierre Crozat. Much admired by fellow artists as well as royalty, she counted among her numerous clients Antoine Watteau and the young Louis XV. Back in Italy, two years later, in 1723, she was invited to the court of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, where she lived for about five months while she created portraits of the princesses of the Este family. In 1730, she travelled with her sister, Giovanna, to the court in Vienna where she worked for about three months, creating portraits of various members of the court, including the Dowager Empress Wilhelmina Amalia.</p>\n\n<p>Carriera’s talent was rewarded by special admission to academies of art in Italy and France, despite their regulations barring female members. In 1705, she was admitted to the Academy of St. Luke in Rome as a meritorious member—rather than as a mere “honorary” member, as was typical for most women admitted to art academies.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> In 1720 she became a member of two other academies: the Clementine Academy in Bologna and the prestigious Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Paris.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout her life, Carriera worked assiduously. She was an astute businesswoman, earned a good living, and invested her savings; she was frequently able to lend money to family members and friends in need. She also dedicated time to female apprentices; one of them, Felicita Sartori (1715-1760), lived and worked in the Carriera home/studio for over 30 years and made a name for herself as a miniaturist, pastellist and engraver. Carriera worked into her early seventies—undergoing surgeries for cataracts, only partially successful, until blindness forced her to stop.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><strong>Miniatures and Pastels</strong></p>\n\n<p>Early in her career, Carriera was renowned for her delicate miniature portraits and allegories in tempera, watercolor, or gouache on an ivory ground. She helped raise the status of miniature painting to a fine art by removing it from the purely decorative realm of snuff boxes. She was one of the first artists in Europe to bring the feel and texture of large paintings to the miniature form, and her innovative techniques influenced the evolution of the art of miniature painting over the course of the eighteenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> At first Carriera used the ivory bottoms or tops of snuff boxes (no longer attached or functioning as such) for her miniatures, but eventually she began to purchase small pieces of ivory and have them cut to size, usually in a vertical oval form. She covered her miniatures with glass and mounted them in metal or tortoiseshell cases before sending them to her clients, who could display them in cabinets, keep them in coat pockets, or hang them from ribbons around their necks.

Indeed, about three-quarters of the roughly 440 works attributed to her are pastels.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> The Venetian artist helped transform pastel chalks from something used mostly for preliminary sketches to a respected and popular medium for portraiture. French and Italian artists who admired and were influenced by Carriera include Charles-Antoine Coypel, Maurice Quentin de LaTour, Giovanna Fratellini, Jean-Baptiste Perroneau, Pietro Rotari, Nicolas Vleughels and Antoine Watteau.

In fact, the majority of the individuals from the database who have some connection to Carriera sat for a pastel portrait or commissioned allegorical works in pastel. Some of the most well-known British Grand Tourists in the <em>Explorer</em> with pastel portraits by the Venetian artist are <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/543\" target=\"\\_blank\">Gustavus Hamilton, Second Viscount Boyne</a> (1710-1746, travel years 1730-1731), <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2956\" target=\"\\_blank\">Henry Fiennes Clinton, Ninth Earl of Lincoln</a> (1720-1794, travel years 1739-1741), <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3185\" target=\"\\_blank\">Charles Lennox, Second Duke of Richmond</a> (1701-1750, travel year 1721), <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3305\" target=\"\\_blank\">Charles Sackville Middlesex, Second Duke of Dorset</a> (1711-1769, travel years 1731-1733) and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4469\" target=\"\\_blank\">Joseph Spence</a> (1699-1768, travel years 1731-1733, 1739-1741), <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5088\" target=\"\\_blank\">Philip, First Duke of Wharton</a> (1698-1731, travel years 1719, 1726, 1728), and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4129\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lewis Watson, Second Earl of Rockingham</a> (c. 1714-1745, travel years 1733-1734).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-89\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sama-figure-89.png\" id=\"fig89\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap89&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap89\">\n\n<b>Figs. 8-9.

This strategy was highly successful with Grand Tourists who specifically requested pictures depicting mythological figures, allegorical figures or portraits of beautiful Venetian women as well as portraits of themselves. Her sets of the Four Seasons and the Four Elements were very popular, as were her renditions of Diana and Flora.<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1405\" target=\"\\_blank\">Robert Dingley</a> (1710-81, travel years 1733-34), collector and future director of the Bank of England, wrote to Carriera from London in 1735, requesting a picture of a “pretty young country girl” in the guise of Winter, specifically “like the one in the cabinet of <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4417\" target=\"\\_blank\">Mr. (Joseph) Smith</a>” (c. 1674-1770, travel years c. 1700-1770). It is likely that Dingley had noticed this picture during his Italian tour in the personal collection of Smith, who spent most of his life in Venice as a merchant banker and as the British Consul from 1744 to 1760. Dingley hastened to add that there was “no need to say anything to Mr. Smith about this.”<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup> His letter reveals how Carriera at times needed to deftly and discreetly serve the ambitions of multiple, competitive British clients.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1012\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sama-figure-1012.png\" id=\"fig1012\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1012&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1012\">\n\n<b>Figs. 10-12.

Her miniatures’ tiny sizes (ranging from c. 7x5cm to 15x10cm) meant they were easy to wear, carry or send by post. Carriera’s pastels did not need the extensive drying time of oil paintings, and their generally moderate size (ranging from 30x25 to 70x50 cm) made them relatively easy to ship or, ideally, have hand delivered through couriers and friends traveling to other cities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exploring the Grand Tour Explorer: Carriera’s connections with other women</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most of the travelers that emerge from searching for Carriera in the <em>Explorer</em> are already known to scholars of the British Grand Tour. But the search results produce new groupings among her British interlocutors—leveling famous with less well-known clients, acquaintances with friends, intermediaries with visitors to her studio. They therefore offer us a uniquely nuanced and textured view of Carriera’s Grand Tour connections.</p>\n\n<p>One way I attempted to harness the powers of the Explorer was to tap it for information regarding Rosalba Carriera’s connections with other women. By using the “Free word search” term and filtering for gender with search terms such as woman, wife, widow, daughter, Mrs., etc. the database led me to two women: <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/621.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Elizabeth Eaton Broughton</a> (d. 1734, travel years 1691-1734) whom we hear about through the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entry on her husband, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/621\" target=\"\\_blank\">Hugh Broughton</a>, British Consul of Venice (d. 1716, travel years -1691-1716); and the pastellist, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4047\" target=\"\\_blank\">Katherine Read</a>, sometimes referred to by contemporaries as “the present English Rosalba”<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> and one of the few women with her own entry in the original <em>Dictionary</em>. I was already familiar with Broughton and Read because of their (spare) presence in the Carriera correspondence. However, because the <em>Explorer</em> search aggregated them into a single result, I noticed that they both highlighted difficulties Carriera experienced in working with the impresario <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4657\" target=\"\\_blank\">Owen Swiney</a>, who acted as agent and intermediary between the artist and her British clients, handling commissions, deliveries and payments.<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> I was therefore able to look at these women in a new way, appreciating their role as sources of information on Carriera as a businesswoman, and considering further the artist’s place in a network of supportive women.<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Unlike many of the travelers in the <em>Explorer</em> database, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/621.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Elizabeth Eaton Broughton</a> was a long-term resident in Venice. From 1690 to 1716 she lived there in her role as wife of the <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/621\" target=\"\\_blank\">British Consul</a>. After her husband’s passing, she remained in the lagoon city (or at least sojourned there) until her own death nearly twenty years later in 1734.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> The two extant letters Broughton wrote to Carriera indicate that she was a close friend of the artist and her family, and that she interacted with them in both English and Italian. One of the letters reflects a quotidian familiarity between the two women; in it, Broughton extends an invitation to Carriera’s sister Angela for a “country gallop a satterday in y.e afternoon” in Mestre, should weather permit such an outing.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/621.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Broughton</a> penned the other letter (in Italian) in 1721 soon after Carriera returned to Venice following the artist’s year away in Paris. Perhaps in part because Carriera was still re-inserting herself into life and work in Venice, Broughton wrote in order to relay confidential information about current gossip regarding payments for Carriera’s paintings: “My dear friend, since <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4657\" target=\"\\_blank\">Mr. Sueniy</a> has let all our compatriots know that he isn’t giving more than 15 sequins for the Portrait you made of Milord, I thought it a good idea to warn you, so that you can act accordingly and make sure you are well paid for the one of Mr. Ratley, and have no other regard than your own interest.” After penning the closing salutation, Broughton made sure to add, “I send this for your information and all of it must remain between us.”<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup> Although Carriera’s work diary—the principal source we have of payments received—is silent at the time Broughton penned this letter, we know that between 1723 and 1728, the artist charged roughly 22 sequins for a large pastel portrait. We also know that her prices generally remained consistent throughout her career. Furthermore, Broughton—a well-informed and well-connected member of British grand tourist circles—clearly indicates that she thought Swiney was promoting insufficient remuneration of the artist.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Thirty-odd years later in 1753, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4047\" target=\"\\_blank\">Katherine Read</a> wrote to Carriera from Paris, after having recently visited the 80-year old Venetian artist in her studio and made her portrait. She noted that she was taking great pleasure in viewing works by Carriera at the Académy Royale de Peinture and in private collections. Since she was about to return to London, she asked if she might be of service regarding some (unidentified) business with <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4657\" target=\"\\_blank\">Swiney</a>. The impresario-agent appears at the center of the next extant letter from Read, which she wrote after hearing from Carriera for the first time in a year. The lack of communication, and a rumor of the artist’s death, had previously led Read to mourn Carriera as “a friend and an artist without equal who had brought greater honor to her sex than had ever been done before.”<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup> This letter reveals that Read has been trying for nearly two years to help Carriera and Consul <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4417\" target=\"\\_blank\">Joseph Smith</a> (in whose care Read had previously sent letters to Carriera) receive money owed to them by the recently deceased Swiney. She had even consulted a friend who had transcribed a copy of Swiney’s last wishes and she was told that the impresario had left everything to “Mademoiselle Woffington”<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> who, in turn, told Read that just before his death, Swiney claimed he owed the Venetian artist nothing. Read explains all of this to Carriera in her letter, saying that she hopes “with all my heart that you can recover your money,” but she is not optimistic.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The younger artist concludes her letter expressing her desire to purchase one of Carriera’s works: a Madonna “which I think I heard was your last work” or a Cleopatra, “or another of your finest ideal heads,” whichever the artist would prefer to part with. She tells Carriera that she will pay whatever the artist wishes, and with her closing line she promises that she “will be more punctual than <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4657\" target=\"\\_blank\">Swinnie</a>.”<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> Clearly, Carriera was still conducting business despite her blindness and advanced age, and British travelers were still active participants in her professional life.</p>\n\n<p>The letters of <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/621.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Broughton</a> and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4047\" target=\"\\_blank\">Read</a> give us a brief behind-the-scenes look into the ways friends, artists, patrons and agents navigated the waters of producing and selling art. Like the letter mentioned above from <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1405\" target=\"\\_blank\">Robert Dingley</a> to Carriera, these missives also reflect the highly interconnected and at times secretive social networking among British travelers to Italy. When considered together, the three letters allow us to consider how Carriera interacted with that network as a businesswoman. Were Broughton and Read writing to her simply as supportive friends? Or were they also writing as women seeking to protect another woman (artist) from being exploited by a man like <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4657\" target=\"\\_blank\">Swiney</a>, who could manipulate the art market in British circles? Regretfully, if Carriera penned responses to these letters, they are lost to us, so we can only speculate about what her thoughts might have been. Nevertheless, it is clear that the artist gained important information from women such as Broughton and Read. Ultimately, as Carriera’s correspondence reveals, her business could both benefit and suffer from the close connections and maneuverings in the circles of British travelers to Italy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Into the studio</strong></p>\n\n<p>What might the <em>Explorer</em> be able to tell us about Carriera’s studio? The richest source of information on the physical layout and contents of the studio is the inventory of Carriera’s belongings after her death.<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> We thus know that when visitors entered the gallery area of the artist’s studio, they would have stepped into a large, comfortable, vibrant space decorated with green wallpaper and gilt-framed mirrors. The room was populated by numerous chairs upholstered in green damask, small Chinoiserie tables and a small clock set on a pedestal. At the ready were sets of porcelain cups and saucers for hot chocolate and coffee. In winter, visitors could warm themselves by the fireplace as they studied the paintings on display: the inventory notes twenty pastels and seven oil paintings in the gallery in addition to numerous other works of art in the central corridor (<a href=\"#figure-13\">Figure 13</a>).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-13\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sama-figure-13.jpg\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap13&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap13\">\n\n<b>Fig. 13:</b> An excerpt from the inventory that was made of Rosalba Carriera’s studio following her death. This document is a rich source of information about the physical layout of Carriera’s studio, but the <i>Grand Tour Explorer</i> complements this by enabling the researcher to quickly bring together several accounts of those who sat for portraits in her studio, offering a traveler’s perspective on her process. Inquisitori alle acque, b. 79, no. 80 [carta con “Nella Galleria”].\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>I hoped the <em>Explorer</em> could help me learn more about the process of sitting for a portrait in Carriera’s studio as well as the studio’s role as a social space. I was, therefore, looking for first-hand descriptions by Grand Tourists of their visits to the studio, something I could do efficiently because the database includes excerpts from travelers’ letters and journals. I created search term combinations such as “Carriera”/“Rosalba” combined with words and phrases such as: “studio,” “sat to,” “sitting,” “miniature,” “pastel,” “portrait,” “likeness,” “draw,” “paint,” “chalk,” “studio,” “mask,” etc. These searches resulted in, among others, three entries for <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4366\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Sinclair</a> (after 1714-1776, travel years 1737-1738), <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1760\" target=\"\\_blank\">Martin Folkes</a> (1690-1754, travel years 1733-1735) and <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/368\" target=\"\\_blank\">Willem (or William) Bentinck</a> (1704-1774, travel years 1727-1728). The <em>Explorer</em> search results pushed me to consider the three entries together as a group. The result is that we are granted a more vibrant and nuanced picture of life inside Carriera’s studio from the traveler’s vantage point.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors frequently remarked that Carriera had portraits of their compatriots on display in her studio. When <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4366\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Sinclair</a> visited the artist in the spring of 1738, he noted in his travel journal that he “saw many of her Portraits, both men and women, several english [sic] among them.” Keeping these likenesses about the studio was surely Carriera’s strategy not only to exhibit her talent but also to induce visitors to have their own portraits made by the famous artist’s hand. In this way, she promoted the notion that possession of her artworks was a benchmark of social success.</p>\n\n<p>The display of such portraits also served a social function in the life of the studio. <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1760\" target=\"\\_blank\">Martin Folkes</a>—scientist, antiquary and protégé of Isaac Newton—visited Carriera in the summer of 1733 as part of his travels in Italy. In his journal on 14 July, he noted that the artist’s “pictures in crayon have been with Justice esteem[e]d the most excellent pieces of art of that sort.”<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> He described the artist as “now better than 50” (she was 60 years old) and declared that during his visit to the studio he was “extremely well entertained with a great number of fine portraits some of my acquaintance very like.” Folkes also mentioned seeing an Allegory of Music in the studio, which he declared to be “as fine and well disposed as almost anyth[ing] I have seen.” He believes the model for the painting was the lover of an Englishman.<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Whether or not visitors commissioned a work by Carriera, then, it could please and amuse them to find their acquaintances visually present in the studio along with them. By functioning as “virtual” companions and as conversation pieces, the portraits enhanced the level of sociability in Carriera’s studio by encouraging sitters and guests to feel at ease and engaged. Although the excerpt is not included in the <em>Explorer</em> entry, <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1760\" target=\"\\_blank\">Folkes</a>’ journal supplies us with further information about social life in the studio. Folkes noted that all three Carriera sisters were present during his visit—Rosalba, Giovanna and Angela—and he remarked that the latter expressed “a great regard” for England, since she had sojourned there with her husband, the artist Antonio Pellegrini.<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup> Not only did Angela and especially Giovanna work in the studio; they also engaged in professional networking by participating in social gatherings with visitors and potential clients.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> entry on Anglo-Dutch traveler and statesman <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/368\" target=\"\\_blank\">Willem (or William) Bentinck (van Rhoon)</a> is especially rich regarding Carriera’s studio.<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup> Excerpts from Bentinck’s and from his tutor’s letters to family in England offer what may be the most detailed account that we have of a client sitting to Carriera. In 1727, as part of a two-year tour of Europe, the grand tourist and his tutor <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/389\" target=\"\\_blank\">Moses Bernège</a> (travel years 1717-1728, 1730-1731) spent three weeks in Venice. Just prior to their arrival in Venice, they had seen and admired Carriera’s portraits of King Augustus in Dresden. Bentinck sat to Carriera, intending the portrait to be a gift for his mother, the Dowager Countess of Portland. Bernège’s letter to the Countess discloses that when Bentinck arrived for the fifth and final sitting, “Rosalba chastised him roundly” for having cut his hair.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> In Bernège’s account the artist was so frustrated at the change in her client’s appearance from his previous sittings that she demanded that he complete the portrait himself by drawing in his hair the way it was before he had cut it. This image of an impatient Carriera is echoed in her correspondence where she occasionally bemoans the fact that she must spend time making portraits of so many <em>inglesi</em> that she cannot get to her other commissions, even for important, royal patrons.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> search results prompted me to take a closer look at the <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/389\" target=\"\\_blank\">Bernège</a>/<a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/368\" target=\"\\_blank\">Bentinck</a> papers directly.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> Many of Carriera’s European contacts and clients populate these letters: from couriers and middlemen to clergy, royalty and artists. Details in the manuscripts that are not included in the database allowed me to add further dimension to our view into Carriera’s studio. In contrast to his tutor’s version of events, Bentinck’s is far more peaceable, implying that it had been a collaborative and even thoughtful idea for him to draw in his own hair, specifically in order to ensure that his mother not be startled by any change in his appearance. As he relates the experience: “But as you remember me with my hair, which was cut off before the Picture was made, that must have made some alteration in the Physio[g]nomy. Yet to prevent that as much as possible and to hide the cutting of my hair, which I did not think you knew, Rosalba gave me her colours, and all the hair upon the forehead, and close to the face are of my own painting, as much as I could remember my hair had been.”<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> Frequently eager to please and assuage his mother in his letters, Bentinck is keen to assure her that the portrait was indeed a good likeness, as “it was thought like by those that saw it at Venice, before I sent it.”<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup> In fact, son and tutor consistently offer conflicting views of the visit. While Bentinck assures his mother that his portrait “will always be worth something,” his tutor notes that there were portraits hanging in Carriera’s studio that were “strong likenesses,” and that Bentinck’s, while good, would have been better had he not cut his hair. Bernège also implies that his ward may have squandered his opportunity for acquiring a fine portrait by Carriera, commenting tersely that “she will stop working very soon as she is starting to become quite aged.”<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> Carriera would go on to work for over two more decades.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/368\" target=\"\\_blank\">Bentinck</a>/<a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/389\" target=\"\\_blank\">Bernège</a> papers also highlight the dangers inherent in shipping works of art and other memorabilia acquired on the Grand Tour: namely, damage and theft. Bentinck’s instructions to the Dowager Countess reflect the attention Carriera gave to protecting her works from damage in transit, a theme that appears frequently in her correspondence. He tells his mother that the portrait will arrive “in a little black frame with a glass over it and must be left so, she [Carriera] herself desired me that it might be left just as it is because taking it out might easily spoil the Picture, and nothing moist must come near it.”<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup> In a subsequent letter, Bernège expresses relief in the knowledge that Carriera’s portrait arrived safely in England “because there was reason to fear that the ship had been commandeered by pirates and taken to Spain. The loss of the portrait would have deeply saddened us.”<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/368\" target=\"\\_blank\">Bentinck</a>/<a href=\"https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/389\" target=\"\\_blank\">Bernège</a> correspondence is also of interest because it may challenge the oft-quoted notion that the creation of pastel portraits was a quick affair, especially when compared to portraits in oil, which required extensive time to dry. Bernège reported that “Madame Rosalba took great care to do it, and requested several visits of Monsieur Bentinck so she could be as successful as possible.”<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup> Perhaps pastel portraits did take longer than is usually assumed if Carriera typically had her clients sit to her several times for one portrait.</p>\n\n<p>As we have seen in the case with Rosalba Carriera, navigating the <em>Explorer</em> in combination with primary sources is an effective and engaging way to build a more nuanced map of the connections between British Grand Tourists and their Italian contemporaries. In diverse ways, the <em>Explorer</em> exemplifies the best of digital humanities resources. Its accessibility online makes it a resource not only for scholars, but for any interested reader, regardless of one’s knowledge about the world of the Grand Tour. Scholars interacting with the database can design and employ diverse combinations of searches and filters for efficient and precise targeting of information. Finally, one of the <em>Explorer</em>’s most important features is the way that its search power puts seemingly unrelated pieces of information (some familiar, some not) into dialogue with one another, leading to new perspectives, questions and ideas.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ex2B4Int9NgSkkf8kQ8vKCSATOKxR0UBdB4yzlkJ8I/edit#gid=0\" target=\"\\_blank\">Download and explore the data behind this essay.</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3>Bibliography</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Primary Sources</strong></p>\n\n<p>Letters to the Countess Dowager of Portland from her sons, William and Charles Bentinck, and their tutors; 1718-31.

See also John Brewer \"Whose Grand Tour?\" in María Dolores Sánchez-Jáuregui and Scott Wilcox, eds., *The English Prize: The Capture of the Westmorland, an Episode of the Grand Tour* (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012), pp. 45-61, for expanding the scope beyond the \"typical\" Grand Tourists.\n\nMy initial approach was very basic: simply looking at patterns of travel and the relative popularity (in terms of numbers of visitors, rather than length of stay) of individual cities. Figures 1 and 2 show the number of travelers to individual cities by decade; [Figure 1](#figure-1) shows the five most popular cities; [Figure 2](#figure-2) shows the ten most popular cities.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"sweet-figure-1.svg\" id=\"fig1\" onload=\"resize(this, getElementById(&apos;fig2&apos;))\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig2&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap12&apos;))\"/> </a> <a name=\"figure-2\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"sweet-figure-2.svg\" id=\"fig2\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig1&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap12&apos;))\"/> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap12\">\n\n<b>Fig. 1 and 2:</b> Bar and line graphs charting the numbers of travelers by start year of travel to selected cities. The top five cities bear out many known patterns, however the addition of the next five cities complicates the picture of rising and falling traveler numbers. Note that the number of travelers has been aggregated by decade. This has been done for readability, as absent data prevents perfect continuous representation by individual year. (For another strategy, see the use of a moving average trend-line in <a href=\"/gt-book/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel Midura's essay</a>.)\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe data helps to clarify what most of us who have studied the Grand Tour without engaging in any quantitative analysis knew anyway: that travel declined in times of war---most strikingly in the 1740s during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748), and to a lesser extent during the American War of Independence (1775-1783); that Naples was increasingly popular as a destination in the latter half of the century, and that Rome was the most frequented city by some margin. The data also confirms that numbers of travelers increased significantly after the Peace of Paris (1763), and that travel did not immediately stop following the outbreak of the French Revolution (1789). Beyond the main four cities (and initially Padua), cities such as Bologna, Genoa, and Milan showed more or less the same pattern: a small but steady increase in numbers, particularly after 1760, until a stabilization or decline at the very end of the century. Although new areas were added to the tour of Italy---notably south of Naples in the later eighteenth century---Padua was the only destination which saw a clear decline in significance in the itineraries of British travelers over the course of the eighteenth century.\n\nThe dominance of Naples over Florence in the last two decades of the century is a striking feature. Again, one might have inferred this from the comments of visitors in journals, letters and topographical literature: enthusiasm for Naples and the warm south was growing while anxiety about its dangers and licentiousness diminished, whereas the charms of Florence were felt more keenly earlier in the century. Meanwhile, the rediscovery of medieval and early Renaissance Florence---the version of the city which so charmed the Victorians---had yet to be made.[^3] Similarly, although Venice was always one of the most important destinations of the Italian tour, the data suggests that it was overtaken in popularity by Florence and Naples during the second half of the century until the last decade. There are a number of reasons why this might have been the case: first and most pragmatically, while both Florence and Naples were centers where British tourists were happy to reside for weeks or even months, Venice was a city through which visitors passed much more swiftly, seldom spending more than a week or two. There is therefore a higher chance that visits went unrecorded. The relative downward trend in Venice's appeal is borne out by more qualitative comments, the tenor of which showed increasing awareness of Venice's decline and a greater inclination to find fault with the city's appearance, its society, and its virtue. In the 1790s, however, when visitor numbers in other cities were falling, numbers in Venice (and to a lesser extent to Padua) increased: a shift that reflects the geopolitics of the time as travelers were funneled out of Italy through the Austrian Tyrol, rather than through enemy France.[^4]\n\n[^3]: On attitudes towards and relative popularity of the different cities see Sweet, *Cities and the Grand Tour*, chapters 2-5.\n\n[^4]: For more on shifts in transalpine travel, see the essay by Rachel Midura.\n\nThe most striking point, however, is the dominance of Padua in the early eighteenth century. Indeed, during the first decade of the eighteenth century we know of more travelers in Padua than in any other city, Rome included. In the second decade the number was equal to those in Rome, by the third decade Padua appears to have been losing its dominance, and by mid-century it had become, apparently, a relatively unimportant destination on the British Grand Tour. In general terms, this broad outline bears out what we know already: the reputation of Padua's medieval university was in decline during the eighteenth century; it was not a contemporary hub of major artistic or cultural production, nor was it a political or religious center.\n\nBeyond that, this data highlights one of the problems with the archival base of *A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy*, compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells (1997), which is carried over in the *Explorer*. A key source for the compilers of the *Dictionary* was the register of matriculation at the [University in Padua](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/search/%7B%22entry%22:%7B%22terms%22:%5B%7B%22value%22:%22university%20of%20padua%22,%22beginning%22:true,%22end%22:true%7D%5D,%22sections%22:%5B%7B%22key%22:%22biography%22,%22name%22:%22Biography%22,%22checked%22:true,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12578%22%7D,%7B%22key%22:%22narrative%22,%22name%22:%22Narrative%22,%22checked%22:true,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12579%22%7D,%7B%22key%22:%22tours%22,%22name%22:%22Tours%22,%22checked%22:true,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12580%22%7D,%7B%22key%22:%22notes%22,%22name%22:%22Notes%22,%22checked%22:true,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12581%22%7D%5D,%22operator%22:%22or%22%7D%7D){:target=\"\\_blank\"}, which visitors in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries made a point of signing.[^5] As Ingamells explained in his introduction to the *Dictionary*, this source allowed the compilers of the *Dictionary* to document visitors passing through Padua early in the century more completely than for most other cities. However, the declining numbers that we see from the 1730s also correspond with a decline in the practice of signing the register: the last signature was recorded in 1765.[^6] This does not mean that visitors were no longer passing through the city; simply that there was no longer a single source of evidence to verify their presence; the reliability of the *Dictionary* in noting visits to lesser cities is, unsurprisingly, therefore less consistent.\n\nThis point, of course, applies to any city where visitors spent a matter of days rather than weeks, and reflects the interests of those compiling the *Dictionary*, whose agenda was the history of art and collecting, as well as the examination of the social networks of those who were engaged in shaping taste and exercising patronage. The experience of travel per se was not their driving concern. For example, the visit to Padua by the Norwich merchant [Robert Harvey](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2294){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1753-1820, travel year 1773, GTE 2294) was undocumented in the *Dictionary*; however, his journal records that he became stuck in the mud outside Padua and spent the following day wandering around \"this large, straggling, ill built, ancient city with arcades said to have been built by Antenor, whose tomb they pretend to show you.\"[^7] Yet the entry in the *Dictionary* has him proceeding from Rome to Venice, in common with many other entries, with no mention of any of the intervening cities.\n\n[^5]: Horatio F. Brown, *Inglesi e Scozzesi all' Università di Padova dall' anno 1618 sino al 1765* (Venice, 1921).\n\n[^6]: Ingamells, *Dictionary*, p. x.\n\n[^7]: Norfolk Record Office MS 20677 Journal of Robert Harvey, entry for 26 Oct. 1773 (p. 210).\n\nNumbers of visitors to all cities increased in the 1760s, but the spike for Turin is particularly noticeable; moreover, the increase was not sustained subsequently whereas in other cities numbers of visitors continued on an upward trend. The pattern becomes clearer if we look at Turin in isolation ([Figure 3](#figure-3)).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sweet-figure-3.svg\"  onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\"/> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap3\">\n\n<b>Fig. 3:</b> Number of travelers as counted by start year of travel to Turin. The graph shows the anomalous spike in numbers of travelers between 1761-1770.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nTurin's geographical situation ensured its importance as a center for travelers, being the first major city for those who approached Italy via the Mt. Cenis pass. Travelers conventionally stayed there for at least a couple of days, if not longer, to recover from the rigors of the journey and admire the view of the mountains which they had so recently traversed. As the \"bear-leader,\" [Joseph Spence](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4469){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1699-1768, years of travel 1731-3, and 1739-41), informed his mother: \"The view we have from the ramparts is the prettiest and the most extraordinary I ever saw in my life, for on one side you see the Alps, rugged and all covered with snow, and on the other the most beautiful hills sprinkled with little country seats, vineyards, fine clumps of wood, and the Po, running at the bottom of them.\"[^8] The presence of the court, reckoned by Spence \"one of the politest in Europe,\"[^9] was always an attraction, as were the royal art collections, the University and the formal symmetry, regularity and monumentality of the new town. The dramatic surge in visitors in the decade 1761-70 is therefore somewhat puzzling.\n\n[^8]: Slava Klima ed., *Joseph Spence: Letters from the Grand Tour* (Montreal and London: McGill University Press, 1975), p. 227, Spence to his mother, 7 Nov. 1739.\n\n[^9]: *Ibid*., p. 74, Spence to his mother, 27 Oct. 1731.\n\nThe spike in visitors might well reflect the vagaries of the evidence compiled for the *Dictionary* and the idiosyncrasies of principles for inclusion, but it could also be occasioned by shifts in Alpine travel, as discussed by [Midura in this volume](/gt-book/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival){:target=\"\\_blank\"}. One further reason for the attraction of Turin to British visitors is worth consideration: the Royal Academy (*Reale Accademia di Savoia*), reorganized by the King of Sardinia in 1729 for the education of the European elite and a key destination for many of the aristocratic youth, who stayed there for months at a time with their tutors. Young elite men attended the Accademia (and other similar academies throughout Europe) in order to perfect physical skills such as horsemanship, fencing, or dancing, and to be taught subjects such as fortifications and mathematics.[^10]\n\n[^10]: Paola Bianchi, \"In cerca del moderno.

Using their birth dates, I identified the number of travelers per decade who were between the ages of 15-25 at time of travel.[^13] This is an approximate exercise given that only around 41% of the entries have confirmed birth dates. However, it is likely that the majority of those whose birth dates are recorded would have been members of the aristocratic elite whose lives in general are so much better documented. The peaks in terms of the presence of travelers in Turin designated as \"youths\" based on this criteria can be related to those identified by Paola Bianchi in terms of attendance at the Accademia by British noblemen and their tutors.[^14] Bianchi's data shows that the Accademia was at its most popular amongst the British aristocratic elite during the period 1745-65, a pattern that calls for comparison with what the *Explorer* data shows.[^15]\n\n[^13]: At the time of writing, 2431 travelers have associated birth dates, out of the total 5972 in the *Explorer*.\n\n[^14]: Paola Bianchi, \"The British at the Turin Royal Academy: cosmopolitanism and religious pragmatism\", in Paola Bianchi and Karin Wolfe eds., *Turin and the British in the Age of the Grand Tour* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017), pp. 91-107, 399-410.\n\n[^15]: Paola Bianchi, 'In cerca del moderno', p. 1032\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\"></a>\n\n| Years   | Number of British |\n|:--------|------------------:|\n| 1733    |                 3 |\n| 1736-40 |                15 |\n| 1741-45 |                16 |\n| 1746-50 |                35 |\n| 1751-55 |                14 |\n| 1756-60 |                30 |\n| 1761-65 |                21 |\n| 1766-70 |                19 |\n| 1771-75 |                13 |\n| 1776-79 |                11 |\n| 1784-85 |                 3 |\n| 1786-90 |                 4 |\n\n<figure>\n\n<figcaption><b>Fig. 4:</b> Table indicating the number of recorded British travelers in Turin in residence at the Accademia.

Moreover, their presence in Turin was the more noticeable because as students of the Accademia they generally spent a period of months rather than days or weeks in the city, in contrast to the travelers who stayed only a couple of days before moving onwards.\n\nThe number of these \"classic\" Grand Tourists (meaning elite, young men) recorded in Turin can therefore be approached as reasonably accurate. Yet it should be noted that Bianchi's data, drawn from the records of attendees at the Accademia in the Treasury archives of Turin, includes 80 names of young men, their companions and their tutors, whose presence in Turin is not recorded in the *Dictionary*. In any case---and possibly also because of the different divisions of time in Bianchi (five year versus ten year intervals)---there is not an exact match in peak numbers between the *Explorer*'s data and that of Bianchi.[^16]\n\n[^16]: Bianchi, \"The British at the Turin Royal Academy,\" pp. 399-410. These figures should be treated with caution given that there is considerably uncertainty surrounding the identification of a number of the names due to vagaries of contemporary spelling and transliteration.\n\n<a name=\"figure-5a\"> </a>\n\n| Decade    | Total Number of Travelers (Known Birth Date) | \\% = Young Men | Total Travelers to Turin | \\% = Young Men | Total Travelers to Rome | \\% = Young Men |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1701-1710 | 170                                         | 60.59%         | 35                       | 40%            | 181                     | 32.04%         |\n| 1711-1720 | 194                                         | 45.36%         | 74                       | 29.73%         | 243                     | 23.87%         |\n| 1721-1730 | 223                                         | 43.5%          | 50                       | 24%            | 425                     | 18.82%         |\n| 1731-1740 | 280                                         | 48.57%         | 123                      | 40.65%         | 395                     | 22.28%         |\n| 1741-1750 | 215                                         | 42.79%         | 50                       | 36%            | 191                     | 27.75%         |\n| 1751-1760 | 278                                         | 46.4%          | 91                       | 45.05%         | 333                     | 28.53%         |\n| 1761-1770 | 382                                         | 46.86%         | 245                      | 27.35%         | 454                     | 25.33%         |\n| 1771-1780 | 401                                         | 35.41%         | 123                      | 20.33%         | 550                     | 18.18%         |\n| 1781-1790 | 353                                         | 31.44%         | 140                      | 18.57%         | 566                     | 13.25%         |\n| 1791-1800 | 284                                         | 30.28%         | 86                       | 17.44%         | 463                     | 14.04%         |\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5b\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sweet-figure-5b.svg\"  onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap5&apos;))\"/> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap5\">\n\n<b>Fig. 5:</b> Number of travelers aged 15-25 as percentage of traveler population with known birth dates by decade intervals.

Towner argued that the high point of the typical \"Grand Tour\" was in the mid-eighteenth century, and began to tail off thereafter as other types of traveler (Towner's \"middle classes\") increased in number.[^17] The detailed picture offered by the *Explorer* data is rather more interesting. The numbers---particularly in Rome and Naples, two of the most popular cities for which most information survives---continued to be higher than in the earlier part of the century. That said, as a proportion of the total number of travelers, the young men were becoming less significant. Meanwhile, a snapshot of those whom we know to have been \"middle aged\" (that is between forty and fifty) shows that their numbers per decade roughly doubled over the course of the century.\n\n[^17]: John Towner, \"The Grand Tour: a key phase in the history of tourism,\" *Annals of Tourism Research*, 12 (1986), pp. 297-333\n\n<a name=\"figure-6\"> </a>\n\n| Decade    | Total Number of Travelers (Known Birth Date) | Number of Middle-Aged Men | \\% Middle-Aged Men |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 1701-1710 | 170                                         | 15                        | 8.82%              |\n| 1711-1720 | 194                                         | 25                        | 12.89%             |\n| 1721-1730 | 223                                         | 28                        | 12.56%             |\n| 1731-1740 | 280                                         | 38                        | 13.57%             |\n| 1741-1750 | 215                                         | 25                        | 11.63%             |\n| 1751-1760 | 278                                         | 27                        | 9.71%              |\n| 1761-1770 | 382                                         | 53                        | 13.87%             |\n| 1771-1780 | 401                                         | 58                        | 14.46%             |\n| 1781-1790 | 353                                         | 61                        | 17.28%             |\n| 1791-1800 | 284                                         | 55                        | 19.37%             |\n\n<figure>\n\n<figcaption><b>Fig. 6:</b> Number of travelers aged 40-50 as count and as percentage of traveler population with known birth dates by decade intervals.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nOne of the great achievements of the *Explorer* is to have identified the many \"hidden\" women, buried in the *Dictionary*, for whom the compilers never thought to devote an entry in their own right. When mentioned, women were generally overshadowed by their male traveling companions: even [Harriet Carr](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/817){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1771-1848, travel years 1791-1794, GTE 817), the amateur artist and traveling companion of her brother, [John Carr](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/819){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1764-1817, travel years 1791-1794, GTE 819), upon whose journals most of the article on her brother's travels was based, only merited a minimal entry in the *Dictionary*, yet she now has an entry of her own in the *Explorer*.[^18] The numerous wives, sisters and daughters (often unnamed) who accompanied other travelers were even harder to detect---a similar problem hindered locating younger brothers and younger sons, servants and the many other unnamed fellow travelers. Many of these individuals have now been extracted from the records and given an entry in their own right in the *Explorer*. Yet the compilers of the *Dictionary* never set out comprehensively to record these \"lesser\" individuals, so despite the best efforts of those involved in the *Explorer* to overcome the aristocratic male bias, it is impossible to make visible those whose existence is not even mentioned in the *Dictionary*---a point taken up also by [Simon Macdonald in this volume](/gt-book/scholars-essays/macdonald-harlequin-horsemanship){:target=\"\\_blank\"}.\n\n[^18]: On the travels of the Carr siblings, see A.W. Purdue, \"John and Harriet Carr: a brother and sister from the north-east on the Grand Tour,\" *Northern History*, 30:1 (1994), pp. 122-38.\n\nAlthough the data will always remain frustratingly incomplete, the general trend illustrated in [Figure 7](#figure-7) shows a marked increase in female travelers during the last three decades of the eighteenth century. Taken with the increasing numbers of older male travelers, this data helps to provide firmer substance to the generalized assertions of an increasingly diverse traveling community by the last decades of the eighteenth century. The first woman to publish on travel to Italy was [Lady Anne Miller](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3324){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1741-1781, travel year 1770-1771, GTE 3324), whose *Letters from Italy* appeared, to a mixed reception from the public, in 1776.[^19] Notwithstanding some stinging criticism from [Horace Walpole](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4974){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1717-1797, travel years 1739-1741, GTE 4974) and others, Lady Miller's *Letters* enjoyed considerable popularity; subsequently other female travelers, such as [Hester Thrale Piozzi](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3880){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1741-1821, travel years 1784-1786, GTE 3880) and [Mariana Starke](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4512){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (c.1762-1839, travel years 1792-1798, GTE 4512), followed suit in publishing their own observations.[^20] The increasing numbers of female travelers and travel writers in the later eighteenth century---both domestically and in Europe and further afield---has rightly attracted recent scholarly attention.[^21] However, it is also important to acknowledge the presence of women *before* the 1770s, now revealed by the *Explorer*, and to be mindful that not all of them were the long-term resident wives of diplomats or merchants. These under-recorded women may not have engaged in the traditional pedagogic program of the Grand Tour or shared in all the cultural experiences that are traditionally held to have defined it, but they were in Italy, experiencing all the differences of cultural and social life that that implies, enduring the physical hardship and discomfort of foreign travel and contributing to and sharing in the experiences of their male companions.\n\n[^19]: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689-1762, travel years 1718, 1739-1741, 1746-1761, GTE 3395[LINK]) famously recorded her journeys, however they were only published later and seemingly against her will.

[Figure 8](#figure-8) compares the number of female travelers against the number of male youth and men of middle age and unspecified age. The most striking point to emerge is that from the 1770s the numbers of women rivaled those of young men traveling in Italy. As already noted, the data, particularly with regard to ages, is incomplete, but it does demonstrate the degree to which patterns of travel had changed by the last two decades of the century. The Grand Tour was increasingly being undertaken by families and groups of mixed ages and genders, whose presence comes across clearly in the more qualitative evidence of journals and correspondence.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-8\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sweet-figure-8.svg\"  onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap8&apos;))\"/> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap8\">\n\n<b>Fig. 8:</b> Bar graph charting the numbers of men, women, and subset of young men among travelers. By 1771-1780, the number of female travelers had outpaced the number of young men.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe changing social profile of travelers was also one of social background and class. This is harder to pursue through the *Explorer*, again due to the limited data for the non-aristocratic elite. The largest single \"Occupations & Posts Group\" category on the *Grand Tour Explorer* is that of statesman or politician (884 individuals) followed by the Army and Navy (291 individuals), confirming the image of the Grand Tour as the training ground of the future social, political and military elite. That said, the statesmen and politicians were precisely those people whose careers are easiest for historians to trace. Only 1,486 of the individuals in the *Dictionary* were assigned explicit occupations and posts, leaving the majority (4,486) without. The \"Employment and Identifier\" category offers another approach, but with its [own caveats](/gt-book/the-grand-tour-explorer/explanation){:target=\"\\_blank\"}.\n\nTwo natural subsets for considering the \"non-elite\" traveler might be the clergy and merchants, however they are each difficult to consider independently from other Grand Tourists for different reasons. Aristocratic young men were almost always accompanied by tutors who were very often members of the clergy, such as the [Reverend Joseph Spence](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4469){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1699-1768, travel years 1731-1733, 1739-1741, GTE 4469), whose comments on Turin from two separate tours that he made in the company of, respectively, the [Earl of Middlesex](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3305){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1711-1769, travel years 1731-1733, 1736-1738, GTE 3305) and the [Earl of Lincoln](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2956){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1720-1794, travel years 1739-1741, GTE 2956), have already been quoted. Merchants are a reasonably numerous category to consider (157 individuals are identified as merchants) but the results of this exercise are skewed by the inclusion of long-term residents in the *Dictionary*, such as the merchants from the English factory at Livorno (Leghorn), who are discussed in this volume in the essays by [Reinert](/gt-book/scholars-essays/reinert-economic-grand-tour){:target=\"\\_blank\"} and [Macdonald](/gt-book/scholars-essays/macdonald-harlequin-horsemanship){:target=\"\\_blank\"}. A number of merchants from Britain did travel, sometimes using the occasion to visit foreign business partners as the opportunity to partake of the wider cultural experience offered by Italy, however merchants were much more likely to be semi-permanent residents of various Italian ports.[^22] Similarly, there was a preponderance of clergy in Rome, which reflects the centrality of Rome to the tour. But for the clergy more than for any other group, Rome would have been a particularly significant destination, given that most clergymen would have enjoyed a rigorously classical education and many had a professional interest in the history of the Christian church. While these groups often had professional ties to the Grand Tour, they complicate our idea of a \"traveler\" on tour.\n\n[^22]: See for example John Patteson and Robert Harvey who were both textile merchants from Norwich; although Patteson for some reason is not returned in a search for \"merchant\": D. Cubitt, A.L Mackley and R.G. Wilson eds., *The Great Tour of John Patteson, 1778-1779,* Norfolk Record Society, vol. lxvii (2003) and Norfolk Record Office MS 20677, Journal of Robert Harvey, 1773. The bookseller James Robson also combined business with pleasure, traveling to Italy to examine the Pinelli Library in Venice in 1787, combining that journey with the traditional itinerary of the Grand Tour (British Library Add MS 38837).\n\nIt is, in fact, relatively difficult to use the *Explorer* to investigate the social backgrounds of travelers from beyond the landed elite. This is due to the limitations of the information in the original *Dictionary*, the inconsistency with which it was recorded by the compilers (for whom documenting social change within the traveling community was not a primary concern) and the blurred lines within British society that separated members of the landed, professional and mercantile classes. Towner's assertion of higher levels of middle class participation is perhaps more emphatic than the data of the *Explorer* suggests; while there is an inherent aristocratic bias in the *Explorer*, Towner's methodology of analyzing published tours similarly has an inbuilt bias towards the middle classes who were far more likely than the aristocracy and landed elite to enter into print.[^23]\n\n[^23]: There were exceptions, of course: see for example *Letters from Italy in the Years 1754 and 1755 by the Late Right Honourable John, Earl of Corke and Orrery, Published from the Originals, with Explanatory Notes, by John Duncombe* (London, 1773); or Sir Richard Colt Hoare, *Hints to Travellers in Italy* (London, 1815). <!--stackedit_data:\n    eyJoaXN0b3J5IjpbNTI4Njc2NTU5LDU4OTk1NjE0OCwxNzk5NT\n    c5MzA1LDQ5NzgzNTk1MCwxNDk3NzUzNjEwLC04Mjk5MDY1Njgs\n    NTI4Njc2NTU5LDUyODY3NjU1OSwtNjI2MTM5Njg1LDEzNzk3MD\n    I0MTcsLTE0MTE5MTAsLTkwODc2OTI5OCw2NzA0Nzc3NTEsLTEz\n    NDE3MTI3MzEsLTU1NTgxODg0NSwtNjMwMDQxNzEzLDExOTYxOT\n    Y0MzFdfQ==\n    -->\n\nOne of the great pleasures of using the *Dictionary* is the wealth of extraordinarily diverse information that it records within the limits of multiple biographical entries, and which cumulatively constitute a uniquely detailed history of eighteenth-century travel. In its print version, it is unwieldy to use systematically (although a number of researchers claim to have read it cover to cover). The *Explorer*, however, makes this information fully discoverable for the first time: as this essay has attempted to show, evolving itineraries or the changing composition of the traveling community by age and gender can be delineated with a far greater degree of confidence than is possible simply through more qualitative analysis. The shortcomings of the data, however, discussed in the Introduction, must always render the conclusions provisional: as this essay has also shown, the questions that researchers may ask of the data were not necessarily those that the compilers had in mind when writing the entries and this has a bearing on the results that the *Explorer* generates. Nonetheless, the *Explorer* makes it possible to establish with far greater confidence who was traveling where and when, thereby providing the framework around which a much more nuanced history of the experience of travel in Italy may be written.\n\n<h3>References</h3>\n\n<div class=\"overlay\" id=\"popup\" style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column; flex-wrap: wrap; background: #f7f6f3\">\n    <div id=\"imgs\" style=\"height:80%\">\n        <div class=\"overlay-close\">\n            <a><i class=\"material-icons\">close</i></a>\n        </div>\n        <img id=\"img\">\n        <img id=\"img2\">\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"capWrapper\" style=\"height:20%\">\n        <p id=\"cap\" style=\"float:left; max-width:80%; position:relative; left:120px; display:inline-block\"></p>\n        <div style=\"display:inline-block; float: right\">\n            <div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column; position:relative; right:100px; top:20px\">\n                <i class=\"material-icons link-cite\" aria-label=\"Cite this image\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">format_quote</i>\n                <i class=\"material-icons link-copy\" aria-label=\"Copy link to this image\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">link</i>\n                <i class=\"material-icons\" aria-label=\"Download\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">arrow_downward</i>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n/*\n* Paired images should have the same height, the smaller of the two.\n*/\nfunction resize(obj, obj2, obj3){\n\n    if (!obj3) {\n        if (obj.height <= obj2.height) {\n            obj2.height = obj.height;\n        } else {\n            obj.height = obj2.height;\n        }\n    } else {\n        height = Math.min(obj.height, obj2.height, obj3.height);\n        obj.height, obj2.height, obj3.height = height;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction zoom(obj, obj2, caption) {\n    var popup = document.getElementById(\"popup\");\n    popup.style.maxHeight = \"90%\";\n    popup.style.height = \"90%\"\n    var image = document.getElementById(\"img\");\n    var image2 = document.getElementById(\"img2\");\n        \n    image.src = obj.src;\n    image.style.display = \"block\";\n    image.style.marginLeft = \"auto\";\n    image.style.marginRight = \"auto\";\n    image.style.left = \"0\";\n    image.style.right = \"0\";\n    image.style.width = \"100%\";\n    image.style.height = \"100%\";\n    image.style.objectFit = \"contain\";\n\n    image2.style.display = \"none\"; // hide in case Fig 1 or 2 were clicked\n    document.getElementById(\"capWrapper\").style.width = image.offsetWidth;\n\n    if (obj2 != undefined && obj2 != null) { // Figure 1 & 2 are paired\n        image.style.float = \"left\";\n        image.style.width = \"50%\";\n\n        image2.src = obj2.src;\n        \n        image2.style.display = \"block\";\n        image2.style.marginLeft = \"auto\";\n        image2.style.marginRight = \"auto\";\n        image2.style.left = \"0\";\n        image2.style.right = \"0\";\n        image2.style.float = \"left\";\n        image2.style.width = \"50%\";\n        image2.style.height = \"100%\";\n        image2.style.objectFit = \"contain\";\n\n        document.getElementById(\"capWrapper\").style.width = image.offsetWidth + image2.offsetWidth; \n    }\n    var cap = document.getElementById(\"cap\");\n    if (caption != undefined && caption != null) {\n        cap.innerHTML = caption.innerHTML;\n        cap.style.display = \"block\";\n        cap.style.marginTop = \"20px\";\n    } else {\n        cap.style.display = \"none\";\n    }\n    var overlays = document.getElementsByClassName(\"overlay\");\n      for (overlay of overlays) {\n        overlay.classList.remove(\"visible\");\n      }\n    popup.classList.add(\"visible\"); \n}    \n</script>"

Some years ago, I published a book that concentrated upon British experiences and representations of Italian cities during the long eighteenth century, Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c. 1690-1820.1 As an urban historian, I was less concerned with what was collected or purchased by travelers, or with their social networks, than with exploring how images of major Italian cities were constructed and considering their influence in British culture.

What new light could the Explorer cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the Explorer tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body? The dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste, acquired and polished in Italy, exercised such a powerful influence upon Britain’s eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.\n\nBut it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic grand tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out throughout my book was the increasing presence of both female travelers and travelers from beyond the landed elite over the course of the eighteenth century, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book: Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile: such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa and Leghorn.\n"
