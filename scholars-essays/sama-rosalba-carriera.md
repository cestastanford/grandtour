title: "6. Going Digital: Re-Searching Connections Between Rosalba Carriera and British Grand Tourists"
author: Catherine Sama
session: 4
chapter: 6
abstract: The career of the Venetian artist Rosalba Carriera (1673-1757) was deeply intertwined with the eighteenth-century Grand Tour of Italy, and British travelers in particular played a vital and multifaceted role in the artist’s work life. In this essay, the search power of the Grand Tour Explorer is used in combination with primary sources to build a nuanced map of Carriera’s connections with these travelers. While there is no entry in the database for the Italian Carriera, searching the Explorer turns up a number of her British interlocutors, including famous and less well-known clients, acquaintances and friends, intermediaries and visitors to her studio. These search results bring new focus to some aspects of the artist’s career. Carriera’s role as a businesswoman is considered through her connections with other women in the Explorer, and her studio, both as a physical and a social space, is investigated through different travelers’ accounts of their visits.

The Venetian Rosalba Carriera (1673-1757) was one of the most important female artists in Europe during the first half of the eighteenth century ([Figure 1](#figure-1)). Her patrons included foreign collectors, artists, and members of the clergy, as well as fellow Venetians and other Italians. Royals across Europe sought her work: Frederick IV, King of Denmark; Johann Wilhelm von der Platz, Elector Palatine; and Frederick Augustus II, Prince-Elector of Saxony (also known as Augustus III, King of Poland), who amassed over one hundred pastels by Carriera for a gallery he dedicated to her in Dresden. Carriera's studio, which she maintained in her home on the Grand Canal, was an important stop on the Grand Tour. Her clients sought portraits of themselves, depictions of various types of allegories, or portraits of Venetian women famous for their beauty or musical talent.[^1]

British travelers were among her most numerous and devoted clients. One of Carriera's most ardent supporters was [Christian Cole](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1035){:target="\_blank"} (fl. 1697-1735, travel years 1701-1705, 1707-1714, 1715), secretary to the [English Ambassador to Venice](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3158){:target="\_blank"}. In a letter to the artist alerting her to the imminent arrival of [Sir Thomas Frankland](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1833){:target="\_blank"} (c. 1683-1747, travel years 1704-1705), Cole noted that his compatriot, "would not like to pass through Venice without seeing the Signora Rosalba [who is] justly esteemed an ornament of Italy, and [the] premier painter of Europe."[^2] When traveling through Venice British travelers also acted as couriers for the artist, ferrying letters, books, pastel chalks and works of art between Carriera and other friends and acquaintances; among these individuals who populate the *Explorer*, we can count Cole, Frankland, and [Thomas Turner](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4868){:target="\_blank"} (travel years 1704-1705). Still others---[Peter Philip Jamineau](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2658){:target="\_blank"} (travel years -1735-1745) and [Owen Swiney](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4657){:target="\_blank"} (1676-1754, travel years 1715-1732)---acted as agents for Carriera, negotiating commissions and arranging for payment and deliveries. In short, Carriera's career was tightly bound to the transactional world of the Grand Tour, and British travelers collectively played a vital and multifaceted role in the artist's work life.[^3]

[^2]: My translation. In the original Italian: "...non vorrebbe passar à Venetia senza veder La signora Rosalba giustamente stimata un ornamento d'Italia, e prima pittrice de l'Europa." The letter is published in Sani, ed., *Rosalba Carriera. Lettere, Diari, Frammenti*, 89. Christopher Johns includes parts of this and other letters from Cole to Carriera in his essay on Cole's influence on the artist's early career: "'An Ornament of Italy and the Premier Female Painter of Europe': Rosalba Carriera and the Roman Academy" in Melissa Hyde and Jennifer Milam, eds., *Women, Art and the Politics of Identity in Eighteenth-Century Europe* (Hants, England: Ashgate, 2003), 20-45.

[^3]: On Carriera's connections to the British, see especially Catherine Whistler, "Rosalba Carriera e il mondo britannico," in G. Pavanello, ed., *Rosalba Carriera 1673-1757 Atti del convegno*, 181-206 and Bruce Redford, *Venice and the Grand Tour* (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996).

I came to the *Grand Tour Explorer* as a scholar of Rosalba Carriera, whose correspondence I am currently co-translating and editing.[^4] With few exceptions (including [Cole](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1035){:target="\_blank"}), British clients and acquaintances are mostly absent from this correspondence. I wondered what further information the *Explorer* could offer about the artist and her interactions with these individuals, beyond the connections already widely established by art historians. This seemed a particularly intriguing question because, as an Italian artist, Rosalba Carriera does not have an entry in the richly detailed *A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy*, compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells (1997). Consequently, information about Carriera cannot be found in one easily identifiable place; instead, references to her appear scattered throughout the entries of the *Dictionary*. The search power of the *Explorer* made it easy to gather these references: one inquiry using the 'Free Search' tool with the terms 'Rosalba' or 'Carriera' elicited 81 entries---a promising start to a more detailed investigation. I decided to explore the database in tandem with Carriera's correspondence, her work diary, and other primary sources to confirm or clarify details about her British clients and to see if I could discover new information. Pairing primary sources with the database's digital search capability was powerful: in some cases it allowed me to trace connections between Carriera and British clients even when neither Carriera nor Venice were mentioned in the *Explorer*'s entries. In others, unexpected aggregations of travelers in the search results produced new questions and ideas.

Searches of the database using specific dates and places also help identify individuals whose names are illegible in manuscript sources. For example, on 9 May 1724 Carriera recorded in her work diary the visit to her studio of a 'M.r Felo inglese' ([Figure 3](#figure-3)). A quick search of the *Explorer* using 'Venice' and this specific date reveals that the British traveler [Coulson Fellowes](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1683){:target="\_blank"} (1696-1769, travel year 1724), was in and around Venice at this time. Even though Carriera is not mentioned in Fellowes' entry and despite the fact that his name is difficult to decipher in the primary source, we can confirm his identity. By perusing Ingamells' *Dictionary* in print form, art historians have used this strategy to resolve questions about Fellowes and several other names in Carriera's work diary.[^5] Anyone seeking to clarify such uncertainties can now do so much more easily using the database.

In this essay I share my experience using the *Explorer* in order to investigate two specific aspects of Carriera's life and work: first, her connections with other women, and second, her studio as a physical and social space. In so doing, I also aim to provide a vademecum of sorts for anyone wishing to navigate the expansive territories of the *Explorer*, particularly for those whose research focuses on the Italians or other Europeans with whom the British travelers interacted.

**Rosalba Carriera**

Little is known about Carriera's early life and artistic training.[^6] Most women who became successful artists had fathers, brothers or husbands who were also artists. This was not the case for Carriera: her father worked as a government office clerk, she had no brothers, and she never married. She maintained her own studio where her sisters Giovanna and Angela (until the latter's marriage) worked as assistants and collaborators. After their father's death, Rosalba---aged 46---became the head of the family household, continuing to live with and support her mother and younger sister Giovanna for the rest of their lives.

[^6]: On Carriera's training, see Sani, "Precisazioni su Rosalba Carriera, i suoi maestri e la sua scuola. Un percorso europeo tra Rococò e Illuminismo," in Pavanello, ed., *Atti del Convegno Internazionale*, 97-113; and Sergio Marinelli, "Antonio Balestra e Rosalba Carriera", Ibid., 115-128.

By her late twenties, the Venetian artist began to make a name for herself throughout Europe. She received invitations to courts across Europe and left the lagoon city for three extended trips. The most important of these was an invitation to Paris, where she lived for a year (1720-21) with her mother and sisters in the home of the financier and collector, Pierre Crozat. Much admired by fellow artists as well as royalty, she counted among her numerous clients Antoine Watteau and the young Louis XV. Back in Italy, two years later, in 1723, she was invited to the court of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, where she lived for about five months while she created portraits of the princesses of the Este family. In 1730, she travelled with her sister, Giovanna, to the court in Vienna where she worked for about three months, creating portraits of various members of the court, including the Dowager Empress Wilhelmina Amalia.

Carriera's talent was rewarded by special admission to academies of art in Italy and France, despite their regulations barring female members. In 1705, she was admitted to the Academy of St. Luke in Rome as a meritorious member---rather than as a mere 'honorary' member, as was typical for most women admitted to art academies.[^7] In 1720 she became a member of two other academies: the Clementine Academy in Bologna and the prestigious Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Paris.

[^7]: See Johns, "'An Ornament of Italy and Premier Female Painter of Europe'".

Throughout her life, Carriera worked assiduously. She was an astute businesswoman, earned a good living, and invested her savings; she was frequently able to lend money to family members and friends in need. She also dedicated time to female apprentices; one of them, Felicita Sartori (1715-1760), lived and worked in the Carriera home/studio for over 30 years and made a name for herself as a miniaturist, pastellist and engraver. Carriera worked into her early seventies---undergoing surgeries for cataracts, only partially successful, until blindness forced her to stop.[^8]

**Miniatures and Pastels**

Early in her career, Carriera was renowned for her delicate miniature portraits and allegories in tempera, watercolor, or gouache on an ivory ground. She helped raise the status of miniature painting to a fine art by removing it from the purely decorative realm of snuff boxes. She was one of the first artists in Europe to bring the feel and texture of large paintings to the miniature form, and her innovative techniques influenced the evolution of the art of miniature painting over the course of the eighteenth century.[^9] At first Carriera used the ivory bottoms or tops of snuff boxes (no longer attached or functioning as such) for her miniatures, but eventually she began to purchase small pieces of ivory and have them cut to size, usually in a vertical oval form. She covered her miniatures with glass and mounted them in metal or tortoiseshell cases before sending them to her clients, who could display them in cabinets, keep them in coat pockets, or hang them from ribbons around their necks. Among the clients present in the *Explorer* who commissioned miniatures from Carriera are [Richard Boyle Burlington](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/707){:target="\_blank"} (1694-1753, travel years 1714-1715), who bought twelve of them, [Lucius Charles Cary](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/834){:target="\_blank"} (1705-1785, travel years 1724-1725), [Christian Cole](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/1035){:target="\_blank"}, [William Osbaldeston](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3682){:target="\_blank"} (1688-1766, travel years 1710-1711), [Mrs. Summers](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4632){:target="\_blank"} (travel years c. 1700-1705), [William Murray, Marquess of Tullibardine](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4860){:target="\_blank"} (1689-1746, travel year 1710, 1717) and [Robert Walpole](http://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4977){:target="\_blank"} (c. 1701-1751, travel years 1722-1723).

Although she enjoyed great success with her miniatures, Carriera is even more famous for her contributions to the medium of pastel. Indeed, about three-quarters of the roughly 440 works attributed to her are pastels.[^10] The Venetian artist helped transform pastel chalks from something used mostly for preliminary sketches to a respected and popular medium for portraiture. French and Italian artists who admired and were influenced by Carriera include Charles-Antoine Coypel, Maurice Quentin de LaTour, Giovanna Fratellini, Jean-Baptiste Perroneau, Pietro Rotari, Nicolas Vleughels and Antoine Watteau. Among British artists who admired, owned or copied her works we may count [George Knapton](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2797){:target="\_blank"} (1698-1778, travel years 1725-1733), [Arthur Pond](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3921){:target="\_blank"} (1701-1758, travel years 1725-1727), [William Hoare](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2446){:target="\_blank"} (1707-1792, travel years 1728-1737), Francis Cotes and [Katherine Read](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4047){:target="\_blank"} (1723-1778, travel years 1751-1753).[^11] The artist's pastels were extremely popular among her clients, whether these were foreign royalty, Venetian patricians, or Grand Tourists. In fact, the majority of the individuals from the database who have some connection to Carriera sat for a pastel portrait or commissioned allegorical works in pastel. Some of the most well-known British Grand Tourists in the *Explorer* with pastel portraits by the Venetian artist are [Gustavus Hamilton, Second Viscount Boyne](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/543){:target="\_blank"} (1710-1746, travel years 1730-1731), [Henry Fiennes Clinton, Ninth Earl of Lincoln](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/2956){:target="\_blank"} (1720-1794, travel years 1739-1741), [Charles Lennox, Second Duke of Richmond](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3185){:target="\_blank"} (1701-1750, travel year 1721), [Charles Sackville Middlesex, Second Duke of Dorset](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/3305){:target="\_blank"} (1711-1769, travel years 1731-1733) and [Joseph Spence](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4469){:target="\_blank"} (1699-1768, travel years 1731-1733, 1739-1741), [Philip, First Duke of Wharton](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/5088){:target="\_blank"} (1698-1731, travel years 1719, 1726, 1728), and [Lewis Watson, Second Earl of Rockingham](https://grand-tour-explorer-2017.herokuapp.com/#/entries/4129){:target="\_blank"} (c. 1714-1745, travel years 1733-1734).
