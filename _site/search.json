        "content"  : "<p>My interest in the Grand Tour explorer arises out of my own work on the engagement of British travelers with Italian cities during the long eighteenth century. Some years ago, I published a book that concentrated upon British experiences and representations of Italian cities during the long eighteenth century, Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c. 1690-1820.1 As an urban historian, I was less concerned with what was collected or purchased by travelers, or with their social networks, than with exploring how images of major Italian cities were constructed and considering their influence in British culture. Given the opportunity to work with the Grand Tour Explorer, I wanted to use it to pursue several questions.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Like many historians, years of immersion in the primary sources meant that I had an intuitive sense of evolving patterns of travel and the composition of the traveling body. However, I was unable to provide any rigorous quantifiable basis for my conclusions or generalizations. How far were my generalizations borne out by the evidence of the Explorer, while taking into account the complex nature of its data, which we know to be far from complete (see the introduction of the book)? What new light could the Explorer cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the Explorer tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body? The dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste, acquired and polished in Italy, exercised such a powerful influence upon Britain’s eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.2 But it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic grand tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out throughout my book was the increasing presence of both female travelers and travelers from beyond the landed elite over the course of the eighteenth century, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book: Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile: such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa and Leghorn.</p>\n"

        "content"  : "<p><em>A World Made by Travel</em> took many years to complete and has incurred many debts. I thank my colleagues and co-founders of the Mapping the Republic of Letters project, Dan Edelstein, Paula Findlen, and Caroline Winterer. Their conversation and company has deeply informed my thinking about the Grand Tour, as have students from the very early days of the project, in particular, in chronological order: Molly Taylor Polesky, Sarah Murray, Thea DeArmond and Rachel Midura. They spent much of their respective graduate years at Stanford contributing to both data collection and conceptualizing the project. They remain for me essential interlocutors. I also acknowledge the undergraduates who worked on the project in its early years—Eliza Lupone and Maggie Medlin.</p>\n\n<p>Nicole Coleman, Academic Technology Specialist at the Stanford Humanities Center and research director of the Humanities+Design Lab at the newly-founded Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA), kept our research agenda on track and fostered the project with her unique and powerful visionary acumen. She led the union of technology and scholarship that created Palladio and our first publications, and fostered collaborations with Elijah Meeks, Jesse Chris, and DensityDesign, and with Giorgio Caviglia, whom she brought to work with us, first as a visiting graduate student and later as a postdoc.</p>\n\n<p>Giorgio Caviglia, during his postdoc years at Stanford, was the lead designer for the Grand Tour Project, from the sixty-nine architects’ case study, to the transformative parsing phase, to the creation of the database and interface for the Grand Tour Explorer. Giorgio brought his dedication to design that beautifully joins clarity and function to all his work on this project, and every page of <em>A World Made by Travel</em> bears his imprint.</p>\n\n<p>A number of Stanford students subsequently collaborated on additional design and development. After Giorgio’s departure in 2015, Cody Leff extended his work beyond graduation, becoming lead designer and developer, with great creativity and adaptability, helping the project to navigate a period of enormous technological transition. Since autumn 2018, Ashwin Ramaswami has been lead developer and designer; our collaboration started when he was a CESTA undergraduate intern, and he continued, somehow, to work devotedly on this project even as he attended law school and afterwards, while running his campaign for state senate in Georgia. Ashwin also mentored other undergraduates who contributed development, in particular Matthew Tan and Joshua Singer. Ryan Tan was extremely helpful with many things, especially data visualization. SriRaagavi Ragothaman joined in leading development and dynamic data visualizations as a graduate student and continued beyond, working tirelessly to bring the project to completion. A number of other CESTA interns and Classics students helped with further data collection and editing: Kevin Garcia, Christine Phan, Noam Shemtov, Clara Romani, Justin Muchnick, Nicholas Clark, Elliot Jones, Sarah Pincus, and Ella Dolan. At CESTA, the project also benefitted from the insight of Erik Steiner, who, as creative director for CESTA’s Spatial History Project, contributed the careful georeferencing of spatial data. Ryan Heuser, during his time as associate director of another CESTA group, the LitLab, generously provided good counsel. CESTA has been essential to this project. I thank CESTA staff, past and present, for their support: Celena Allen, Amanda Bergado, Daniel Bush, Jonathan Clark, Carol Guthrie, Eyüp Eren Yürek, and previous CESTA directors Zephry Frank and Elaine Treharne.</p>\n\n<p>Essential were the 2016 and 2017 events—both titled “Digitizing the Grand Tour: A Workshop on the Worlds and Lives of Eighteenth-Century Travelers to Italy.” Many participants contributed essays to <em>A World Made by Travel</em> (see Scholars’ Essays) and others provided brilliant insights to our conversation: Malcolm Baker, John Brewer, Jeffrey Collins, Paul Davis, Thea De Armond, Ryan Heuser, and Jonathan Sheehan. Thanks also to Dillon Gisch for impeccable organizational assistance and to Rachel Midura for work preparing essays for publication.</p>\n\n<p>The students in the Grand Tour classes I have been teaching have contributed more than they know—in addition to those whose work is featured in Section VI. I want to acknowledge them all, along with the graduate students who co-taught with me: Sarah Murray, Rachel Midura, Nick Gardner, and Annie Lamar.</p>\n\n<p>Colleagues generously helped me think through this project. I am grateful to Ben Albritton, Mark Algee-Hewitt, Rowan Dorin, Mateusz Fafinski, Paula Findlen, David Medeiros, Ian Morris, Grant Parker, Richard Saller, Walter Scheidel, Laura Stokes, Sarah Sussman, Merve Tekgürler, Elaine Treharne, Matthew Warner, and Caroline Winterer. Beyond Stanford, I treasure conversations over the years with Richard Ansell, Ruth Ahnert, Malcolm Baker, Melissa Calaresu, Emma Dench, Federica Favino, Michele Graffieti, Jo Guldi, Tony Grafton, Sue Marchand, Frank Salmon, Alain Schnapp, and Jake Soll. Dr. Kim Sloan generously shared with me her knowledge of Brinsley Ford and the origins of the <em>Dictionary</em>, for which I am immensely grateful. Input from hosts and audiences when I presented phases of the project has been invaluable: Venice University Ca’ Foscari, Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Colgate University, UC Berkeley, Princeton University, Università La Sapienza in Rome, the Annual Conference of the French Society for the Study of the Anglophone World, University of Verona, Sorbonne University in Paris, Guangqi International Center for Scholars at Normal University in Shanghai, Harvard Business School, University of Otago in Dunedin (NZ), Brown University, University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Davidson College, the Society for Classical Studies in New Orleans, St. Anne’s College in Oxford (UK), and the Cini Foundation in Venice.</p>\n\n<p><em>A World Made by Travel</em> required a lot of travel. For their generous hospitality and good company, I thank friends in England (Melissa Calaresu, Miriam Leonard, Ruth Loshak, and Carrie Herbert), in Paris (Gianna Franceschini and Alain Schnapp), and in Italy (Teresa Ceserani, Barbara Colonna, Letizia de Sanctis, Francesca and Ludovico Geymonat, Laura Nuccilli, my mother Anita Piemonti, and my late father Remo Ceserani).</p>\n\n<p>The writing of <em>A World Made by Travel</em> owes an immense debt to my colleague and mentor Susan Stephens, who has read, re-read, and discussed multiple drafts, at once exactingly and encouragingly—the book would not exist without her. Karen Newman has, again, made every page she read both more elegant and insightful. Nicole Coleman has been with me from start to finish—reading drafts, offering treasured advice for big concepts and invaluable and creative input for technical solutions, and providing her voice in the videos. Francesca Trivellato has read much and remains a most challenging and inspiring interlocutor. Feedback by John Brewer has been invaluable. I owe more than words can say to Christopher Rovee’s brilliant generosity in discussing every idea and engaging every sentence in this book and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>Bringing the work of so many years to publication in the innovative program of Stanford University Press has been an exhilarating experience. I want to thank Alan Harvey and Jasmine Mulliken for their support, and Jasmine as well for ensuring the coherence of the whole. Finally, I thank the press’s anonymous reviewers.</p>\n\n<p>The Mellon Center for Studies in British Art made this project possible by sharing the text of the <em>Dictionary</em> in digital form, allowing work in its archives, and supporting this publication. In particular, I thank Brian Allen, Mark Hallett, and Charlotte Brunskill.</p>\n\n<p>I am grateful to Eliana Abu Hamdi and Mae Velloso-Lyons for their extraordinary help with this project at essential junctures. Teresa Ceserani has done exacting work on data editing as associate lead data curator. Thanks to Jake Coolidge for data visualizations for the scholars’ essays, and to Tommaso Elli for his excellent work on the final design and visualizations. Carly Rubin, Christie Cognevich, Tori Bush, and Mary Pappalardo offered essential copyediting. Orso Raymo offered help with data analysis, and I owe a large debt to Ross Perlin for reviewing and improving the whole.</p>\n\n<p>I could not have brought this work to completion without generous institutional support. The launch of the project was supported, via Mapping the Republic of Letters, by grants from the NEH and the Stanford Presidential Fund for Innovation in the Humanities. Since 2013, the contribution in kind of CESTA and the award in 2016 of a Roberta Bowman Denning Innovation in the Humanities Grant have been instrumental. The generous support of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research, the Dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences, the Center for Teaching and Learning, the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, and the Classics Department, as well as the History Department, the Humanities Center, the Europe Center at Stanford, and a New Directions Mellon Fellowship have all contributed. The early workshops also enjoyed support from Stanford’s Division of Cultures, Languages and Literatures, and the Departments of English and of Art History.</p>\n\n<center><h2>***</h2></center>\n\n<p><em>A World Made by Travel</em> is dedicated to Teresa Ceserani, Emilia Moore, and Christopher and Julian Rovee.

They are accounts of determinative decisions and of eureka moments, as well as of paths not taken and of mistakes and failures. These accounts bear the hallmark of experimental science, aimed at sharing experiences for the benefit of subsequent researchers. The urgency that digital humanists feel to communicate lessons learned during the process of developing a project reflects the fact that many did not learn about digital humanities methodologies and practices in the course of their own educations but rather have had to invent their own way of doing things along the way. It is precisely the fast-changing and experimental nature of the digital humanities that ensures the enduring value of these acts of sharing, both project data and project experiences. What follows is another such account. As the founder and director of the Grand Tour Project, involved in every step of the Explorer’s development from start to finish, I take full responsibility for the countless decisions that its creation entailed. But I want to underscore that at every stage, this project has benefited from the invaluable contributions of collaborators—colleagues, students, specialists in computational technology and design, editors, and friends—who are too numerous to systematically name here but who are fully <a href=\"/acknowledgements-and-credits\">acknowledged in the Credits</a>.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-making-of-the-dictionary\">The Making of the <em>Dictionary</em></h1>\n\n<p>The story of <em>A World Made by Travel</em> begins as another story: that of the origins and the making of the <em>Dictionary</em>. John Ingamells’ preface to the <em>Dictionary</em> is concise—only two and half pages—but nonetheless clear in stating how long and complex the history of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s construction was, as well as how preeminent a role Brinsley Ford (1908–98) played throughout the process. The preface delineates the <em>Dictionary</em>’s various phases and the subsequent generations of collaborators and contributors who made it possible to realize Ford’s plan of publication. The <em>Dictionary</em>’s title page describes it as “compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells,” and the preface explains this, while showcasing two now-famous quotations: (1) Ford’s comparison of his work on the Grand Tour to “a snowball which has smothered me and of course one never comes to the end of the subject,” and (2) his recommendation to Ingamells “never to omit ‘the racy bits.’”<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The <em>Dictionary</em> accompanied Ford throughout most of his life as he became an integral part of the British art world. After an Oxford degree, service in the Second World War, and inheriting his family art collection (which itself originated in the Grand Tour), he continued the family’s tradition of collecting and began writing scholarly publications. Ford played important roles in numerous institutions that he supported through his service and, at times, by his own means. In 1951, he published a monograph on the drawings of Richard Wilson (many of which had been in his family since the eighteenth century). The next year he became director of <em>The Burlington Magazine</em>, and in 1954, he was named a trustee of the National Gallery. In 1974, he joined the executive committee of the National Art Collections Fund (now The Art Fund), of which he soon became chairman, service for which he was knighted a decade later. He was also a member of the Society of Dilettanti, in which he served as secretary from 1972 to 1988. By 1986, he had become president of the Walpole Society, which in 1998 published a full catalog of his art collection. Ford’s extensive study of the Grand Tour was also a form of collecting as it grew into an open archive available to any interested scholar, its materials serving as the basis for many exhibitions and studies.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The publication project of Ford’s wealth of Grand Tour archival material—which would become the <em>Dictionary</em> as we know it—grew and transformed through time. It originated with a commissioned article for the journal <em>Eidos</em> in 1950, in which Ford decided to focus on the just-discovered <em>Hayward’s List</em>, a ten-page eighteenth-century manuscript recording the names of the 1753–75 arrivals of 120 British artists in Rome. This article did not come to pass: as Ford noted, “long before I completed my researches <em>Eidos</em> had ceased to exist!”<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> The research continued, however, and grew beyond those original 120 artists’ names. In 1962, Basil Taylor (1922–75)—the art historian advising Paul Mellon on British art and who was soon to be first director of the Paul Mellon Foundation—proposed that Ford turn his Grand Tour research into a book for a series planned by the foundation. Ford agreed, ambitiously planning a two-volume publication, with the first to be devoted to the Grand Tour in general and the second to a dictionary of its travelers. This arrangement came with funding from Paul Mellon for a research assistant, and from 1963 to 1967, Ann Martha Wrinch worked with Ford to, as he put it, “help in finding out more information about the Englishmen [on my] files, discover exactly who some of them were, their dates, etc., and if there is any indication that they may have left journals of their travels, to try and find them, and cross index the information.”<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> During this time, the research expanded to archives in Rome, other Italian sources, the Lewis Walpole Library in the US, and various country estates and archives in England. Ford also commissioned a Mr. Ferruccio to transcribe all the records about English travelers in the Notes dei Forestieri in the Archivio di Stato in Venice (and subtle pencil marks next to all English names in the files to this day attest to this work).  But Taylor’s directorship imploded in 1969, and the publishing plan was again shelved—all while the archives continued to grow.</p>\n\n<p>The publication project resumed in 1987 under the sponsorship of the newly established Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London. A contract was signed in 1988 by which the Centre agreed to support the realization of Ford’s publication on the condition that the archive be donated to the Centre and the entire project brought in house. At this time Dr. Kim Sloan was appointed to supervise the completion of the project while working closely with Ford. The material for the travelers’ entries grew further as Sloan searched through newly deposited family materials in the National Archives, as well as the recently indexed Walpole correspondence, while also directing Dr. Ilaria Bignamini to research more Italian archives and sources.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> Soon after, Carol Blackett-Ord and Joanne Elvins started assisting Sloan in England, and more experts were recruited to collaborate on various specific travelers’ entries. Sloan left for a curatorial post at the British Museum four years later, and while hundreds of new entries had been written, many more remained far from finished. Ingamells, recently retired from the Wallace Collection, had a reputation for project completion and was appointed at the close of 1992 and managed, while in consultation with Ford, to bring the project to publication in 1997. Ingamells worked indefatigably and meticulously, giving final shape to vast amounts of reference materials, and editing what had been completed at that point with no new additions. In the interest of finally bringing this work to the printed page, he also made hard decisions, leaving much unpublished, especially material for entries that were diffult to complete. All this material lives on in the Paul Mellon Center in London: here the Brinsley Ford archive, which holds much that did not make it into the print <em>Dictionary</em> (including material intended for the first volume of the work as originally planned), has been fully catalogued, is open for access, and is regularly consulted by scholars from across the world.</p>\n\n<p>This story contains various threads. As <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/macdonald-harlequin-horsemanship#paragraph-6\">Simon Macdonald has observed</a>, the making of Ford’s archive belongs to a moment of renewed interest in prosopography covering eighteenth-century British elites especially, as more and more family papers became available in what Peter Mandler termed “sales of <em>virtù</em>.”<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> In his correspondence, Ford discusses having purchased the House of Commons volumes Lewis Namier had edited, which he saw as a model of engaging collective biography and used to check who among members of Parliament might have taken the Grand Tour. There is also a disciplinary context, as in the UK art history departments began to find their institutional footing around the middle of the twentieth century. Aesthetic criticism, connoisseurship, and art historical scholarship all charted connected but distinct paths. Ford navigated this rapidly changing art world with agility, both as a knowledgeable collector whose opinion was frequently sought and as an amateur scholar in his own right. There is also the matter of research organization and funding, both speaking again to emerging structures. Ford’s 1962–67 Mellon grant is a striking mix of official accounting and personal communication just at the time when the newly established National Endowment for the Humanities began grant-making in the United States in 1966. The dynamics with and trajectories of Ford’s early collaborators prove also interesting to study. Ann Martha Wrinch (later Rowan), referred to as a “secretarial assistant” in the 1960s correspondence, worked for the Ford archive reading journals, extracting information, and cross indexing it; she went on to serve as an archivist in the Irish Architectural Archive. In 2018, she was granted an honorary degree from Trinity College Dublin (in her cohort of five, the only other woman was Hillary Rodham Clinton) for her single-handed creation of the <em>Dictionary of Irish Architects, 1720–1940</em>. The project, which comprises sixty-seven hundred entries covering forty-nine thousand Irish buildings, and is now online and has been open access since 2009, is a notable digital humanities success story.</p>\n\n<p>Many studies of large-scale reference work have proven illuminating to wider intellectual histories, and the <em>Dictionary</em> might well deserve a study of its own. But in terms of the transformation from the print <em>Dictionary</em> to the Explorer, the multiple layers of this story serve as reminders of the variety of contributors and sources that stand behind the travelers’ entries—along with both their gaps and inconsistencies, as well as the possibilities they offer for discovering rich connections across such diverse material. Ford’s correspondence also reveals the steps and choices by which the entries grew from 120 artists on <em>Hayward’s List</em> to more than five thousand travelers’ entries in the published <em>Dictionary</em>, as well as how Ford and his collaborators confronted matters of scale and representation.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1964 letter in which Ford explains his publication plan to Taylor, the longest paragraph is titled “Scope,” and it opens with the question, “Who is to be included?” Ford has no doubts about some: certainly included are all English artists “however unimportant, however little is known about them,” as well as all Englishmen who published books about their travels, kept journals, appeared in the <em>Dictionary of National Biography</em>, or were members of the Society of Dilettanti. Beyond these, though, Ford states that inclusion becomes a matter of “how far to descend in the scale.” Diplomats posted in Italy belong because of their contacts with the travelers, but he says others, about whom little is known, should be included because “someone who now seems obscure could prove of interest” in the future.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> The example that Ford gives is a traveler for whom only a name, a time, and a place is known, thus making the traveler hard to identify; but at a later point, said traveler might turn out to be the subject of a portrait and possibly offer the means by which to date the picture. The promise of future identification and significance opens the door to more and more categories of travelers who can be let in—especially, as Sloan recounts, after Bignamini found many “one-liners” such as ship captains, merchants, priests, and so forth in Italian archives.</p>\n\n<p>This inclusive approach sets the <em>Dictionary</em> apart from most contemporary prosopographies. Ford’s work inscribed a metanarrative into the project, one in which the primary actors of the eighteenth-century Grand Tour were the elites. He primarily covered their lives and the leisure pursuits of the wealthy and well-connected, as well as the fine arts they collected and commissioned. As such, Ford’s archive both remembers and silences. Archives, however, often fail to achieve total control, let alone express a single narrative. They can be pressed for hidden figures and discarded meanings. Although Ford’s archive of archives emphasizes the elites, he also cast his net wide to find as many travelers to Italy as he could; thus, he ended up including a wider spectrum of people than either the <em>Dictionary of National Biography</em> or Colvin’s <em>A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840</em>. For example, the presence of servants was largely suppressed in the travel narratives that Ford consulted, yet the traces of some remained and found their way into his archive and, subsequently, into the <em>Dictionary</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Women provide interesting cases. Overall, they are suppressed—from the male-centered ideal of the Grand Tour; from many of the spaces of the Grand Tour (both educational and professional); and from the entries themselves, which mostly treat for men. Despite this, not only does <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2205\">Emma Hart</a> have an entry separate from <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2219\">Sir William Hamilton</a>, who brought her to Italy and became her husband—as she did already in the 1890 <em>Dictionary of National Biography</em>—but even her mother, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/753\">Mrs. Cadogan</a>, who traveled to Italy with Emma, has her own <em>Dictionary</em> entry, based on the work of Ford and Ann Martha Wrinch. This is in spite of the fact that Mrs. Cadogan otherwise exists as no more than a short reference in some of the writings about her famous daughter. Ford seems to have been interested in recovering some women. When, in 1964, he sent a sample of entries to Taylor, he pointed to his draft of that for Miss Bruce as the one he thought to be best executed. Before this research, Miss Bruce was just a mention in the painter Alexander Cozens’s Italian sketchbooks—where he noted, in the list of his daily activities, “to Miss Bruce” (see fig. 1).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-1.png\" id=\"fig1\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1\">\n\nFig. 1. A section of page 13 of Alexander Cozens&rsquo;s Roman sketchbook as reproduced in print by Adolph Paul Opp&eacute; (see Opp&eacute;, A. P. &ldquo;A Roman Sketch-book by Alexander Cozens,&rdquo; <i>Volume of the Walpole Society</i> 16 (1927): 81&ndash;93, 90) in which Cozens lists visits &ldquo;to Miss Bruce&rdquo; among his planned daily activities for his summer Roman stay, a rare instance of a woman among the circle of painters in Italy.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>But Ford—or was it Ann Martha Wrinch?—connected Miss Bruce to a paragraph in a 1750 letter from Horace Mann to Horace Walpole, fleshing out more of an individual, a young woman painting in Italy. Mann’s letter is written at the young artist’s expense, mocking her as “a virgin” easily offended by naked statues and figures in painting.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> Is Ford reproducing Walpole’s text in some shared humor, or is he struck by the singular presence of a woman’s name in Cozens’s sketchbook or by the unusual fact of a young woman studying painting in Italy? It is hard to say, but such moments make the <em>Dictionary</em> a more inclusive resource that made possible a database containing hundreds of women’s entries. As Catherine Klein and Lauren D’Ignazio put it, “what gets counted counts.”<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>With his archive, more than other prosopographies such as the <em>Dictionary of National Biography</em> or the <em>Dictionary of British Architects</em>, Ford was interested in the connections and overlaps between travelers—what he refers to as cross-referencing and cross-indexing. When asking Taylor in 1964 about the inclusion of illustrations, aside from portraits of the travelers, Ford proposes lists of artists and events in any given year, suggesting a tabular format because “it would be very useful to show which years are fully covered by detailed journals.”<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> Taylor approved of the idea, assuring him that they could provide diagrams, but, again, this did not come to pass.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, preserved in the Ford archive are sketches of timeline visualizations with which he was already experimenting. A couple of sheets of paper stand out among the various travelers’ folders (figs. 2 and 3). The first, in Ford’s hand, captures a timeline sketch, visually recording and organizing information about travelers’ arrival and departure events and giving a glimpse of overlapping travels of artists in Italy (in Florence and Rome, in particular) from 1733 to 1759. The other, in Wrinch’s hand, is dedicated specifically to the 1770s and organizes information horizontally, with attempts to represent different types of temporal information (continuity, uncertainty, etc.) using different line designs—dotted or solid lines, lines ending in arrows or brackets, and so forth. As Ford was trying to manage what seemed an overwhelming and still-growing amount of information, one way to approach the “snowball” of the <em>Dictionary</em> was visualization—an approach taken up in earnest in the Grand Tour Project and <em>A World Made by Travel</em>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-2\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-2.png\" id=\"fig2\" onload=\"resize(this, getElementById(&apos;fig2b&apos;))\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig2b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap2&apos;))\" /> </a> <a name=\"figure-3\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-3.png\" id=\"fig3\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig2&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap2apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap2\">\n\nFigs. 2. and 3.

In the spring of 1998, as a graduate student, I found undetected on an open access library shelf the manuscript of a travel narrative, in the form of a handwritten annotation to an eighteenth-century published travel account. The manuscript was detailed, compelling, and anonymous, and I could not determine who composed it. The author identified himself as “an English gentleman who visited Sicily out of a curiosity natural to travellers,” and the dates for his travel to Sicily were in June 1766.<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup> The <em>Dictionary</em> had just been published, and I searched it extensively for a traveler who was in Sicily in June 1766 to no avail. It was frustrating. Just at this time, we had started experimenting with using and searching large quantities of digitized texts—such as a CD-ROM with the entire corpus of Greek literature. In this context, it seemed natural to imagine a way out of this frustration with a digital version of the <em>Dictionary</em> that one could browse and search at will.</p>\n\n<p>While my work on the mysterious traveler continued in physical archives, it was only a decade later that the Grand Tour Project began in earnest in the context of the collaborative Mapping the Republic of Letters (MRoL) project, where a group of scholars experimented with computational modes and historical research. I was among the MRoL’s founding faculty group, which soon expanded to include students, other researchers, and specialists in technology, particularly in design and visualization. Together we started working with data and thinking through data collection and categorization, spreadsheets, and technology, while learning about collaboration, visualization, and the balance between qualitative and quantitative approaches when using computation.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"mapping-the-republic-of-letters\">Mapping the Republic of Letters</h1>\n\n<p>The idea of the <em>respublica literaria</em>, or Republic of Letters, originated in Renaissance humanism but persisted throughout the eighteenth century in various forms, from provincial academies to early modern colleges, art societies, and the worldly social sites of cafés and salons. At any given time, what held it together—bridging often stark cultural, political, linguistic, and religious divides—was the exchange of words, things, and ideas, for which written correspondence was essential. An “imagined community” vividly meaningful to its participants, the Republic of Letters—together with its various embodiments—is difficult to track in traditional records hosted in states’ and institutions’ archives precisely because of its noninstitutional and transnational essence. “The Republic of Letters: Between Renaissance and Enlightenment,” a conference that took place at Stanford University at the very close of 2007, sought to tackle anew the elusive nature of this premodern community of scholars as a precursor to many later intellectual associations, including the modern university.<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> Over two winter days at the Stanford Humanities Center, short on sunlight but long on presentations, a twenty-first-century scholarly community of varied disciplinary affiliations and areas of specialization probed beyond the national boundaries and traditional periodization limits within which the Republic of Letters is all too often studied. In this expansive geographical and temporal frame, new explorations of questions about such topics as the role of women or the practices and ideals of the Republic of Letters came to the fore.</p>\n\n<p>These discussions continued to resonate among Stanford faculty well after the conference’s conclusion. In particular, studies of individuals’ correspondences—whose reach across great distances in time and space were made so palpable in maps presented by some of the speakers—opened up new vistas and offered inspiration. These were also the years that saw many digital transformations of archival and printed records, as both primary and secondary sources were migrating into PDFs and JSTOR resources, changing how historians worked. What other possibilities would this type of transformation open up? What would the newly available digitized texts and documents reveal? What would metadata help us to see, at a scale well beyond our painstaking studies of individuals’ correspondences?</p>\n\n<p>Out of these conversations emerged a collaborative project among a group of Stanford faculty from different departments, including History, French and Italian, and Classics. The collaboration, formally titled Mapping the Republic of Letters, developed around the shared use of computational methods to study varied aspects of early modern intellectual life, drawing on the very different areas of research of each faculty member.<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup> The initial case studies—including the correspondences of Voltaire (the focus of Dan Edelstein), Benjamin Franklin (the focus of Caroline Winterer), and Athanasius Kircher (the focus of Paula Findlen), as well as my work on the Grand Tour—generated, in turn, collaborations with a number of graduate and undergraduate students and, soon after, a few post-docs, technology specialists, and information designers. This process charted new territory for all involved and, in time, was <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/acknowledgements-and-credits#paragraph-13\">supported by grants</a>, both internal and external, that made it possible to fund student contributions, travel, and support for external collaborators. The learning curve was as steep as it was exciting. Some of the rewards of these efforts came in the form of connections made outside our usual academic corridors. An early animated visualization of correspondence data developed by a research group of students and faculty in Computer Science at Stanford even ended up on the front page of the <em>New York Times</em>,  confirming the importance of thinking in original ways about how we could present our data.<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> The same network graphs developed to explore the Republic of Letters, for example, were being used to uncover hidden relations in the Panama Papers scandal.<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> New lines of scholarship emerged for the project’s lead faculty and students alike, and alongside one another, we reshaped our learning and research practices.<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The visualization in Figure 4 gives a sense of the diverse intellectual landscape of the Mapping the Republic of Letters project—especially the many connections it fostered—while underlining its unique and experimental visual emphasis. The importance of design and data visualization cannot be overstated. Technology and design expert Nicole Coleman, as the academic technology specialist in the Stanford Libraries and the Stanford Humanities Center, organized the various projects in Mapping the Republic of Letters around this crucial axis and cultivated our collaboration with designers (including with the author of the visualization in Fig. 4). This through line is what made Mapping the Republic of Letters distinct as a digital humanities project, and it filtered into the work of the Grand Tour Project. Giorgio Caviglia, as visiting graduate student first and postdoc later, established the design standards for the project that became the crucial foundation for everything that followed all the way through the creation of the Grand Tour Explorer and <em>A World Made by Travel</em>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-4.png\" id=\"fig4\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap4&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\nFig. 4.

The group desired maps that expressed relations in space and time while remaining attentive to ambiguity and missing data. Together, we came to realize how historical data—inherently incomplete, multifaceted, and carrying constant uncertainty—required ongoing critical reading and assessment in our digital work (just as source criticism is so crucial to traditional historical work). With this guiding principle, we came up against the limits of existing computational tools, which struggle with multidimensional, heterogeneous, and incomplete data. We began to design our own tools and visualizations instead, while conceiving of them less as proofs and more as heuristics for finding the right questions and accurately identifying absences. We worked to make tools that would accommodate our humanistic data, just as we realized that our quantitative approach would need to take into account ambiguities and gaps in our source material.</p>\n\n<p>What distinguished the Grand Tour Project within Mapping the Republic of Letters was the focus on travels rather than correspondence—in particular, the movement of British travelers to and around Italy in the eighteenth century. These travels did involve letter-writing: there were letters of introduction and letters sent home to recount travelers’ experiences, some of which were later published. The Grand Tour also entailed a vast movement of objects and knowledge, and in this, it played a fundamental part in the Republic of Letters, from its inception to the Enlightenment. But fundamentally it was about the actual travelers, moving on the ground along the same developing European roads that were taken by postal couriers who carried written letters through Europe. The Grand Tour experience was an essentially spatial one, and maps have long served to represent it. Yet, in the Grand Tour Project, the relationship between digital visualizations and geographical maps has been a testy one, and it remains a work in progress. Just as maps became less and less the focus of Mapping the Republic of Letters generally, so too for the Grand Tour Project, which increasingly focused on the travelers themselves. The flight charts that initially seemed to work for letters never did for travelers, and the problem of missing travel data immediately became clear in early spatial visualizations. And while the correspondence-centered projects focused largely on existing metadata (information about the circulation of letters, made available in novel digital repositories), the Grand Tour Project set its sights on drawing data about travels from a print source, the <em>Dictionary</em>.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"initial-data-collection\">Initial Data Collection</h1>\n\n<p>That one could approach the <em>Dictionary</em>’s structured information as data was already apparent from Brinsley Ford’s speculations about tabular representation of the travelers. But actually making a database out of the <em>Dictionary</em> was a novel enterprise, and its beginnings were a humbling experience. Email threads from the summer of 2008 show the improvisation that marked the early days in which the project was taking shape. This was the first venture into data-focused work for both the faculty and students involved, with the collaborative character of the project emerging in part from the need to learn together. Many group meetings and conversations focused on how to extract data from the <em>Dictionary</em>’s pages. There was also a growing realization that the issues were as much conceptual as technical, and that capturing data is as much about how to categorize and ask questions of it, as about the systematic, repetitive work of tabulation.</p>\n\n<p>There were certainly technical adjustments, as well. For example, early emails included reminders to install new versions of Microsoft Access on laptops before meetings so that the database to be filled could be downloaded. Although such issues seem quaint now, some remain central to questions of accessibility and sustainability whose significance is even clearer now than it was then. For example, the Apple collaboration platform that we first used is no longer supported—and therefore that documentation is now lost.</p>\n\n<p>As for structural and conceptual issues, the database was designed to be filled with columns for each traveler that, given the original interest in mapping, privileged spatial information. This design was based on our understanding of the <em>Dictionary</em> at the time, which was mostly informed by the better-known individuals and travels it represented. We created a column for cities visited and for places stayed, as well as columns for relevant temporal information, such as dates of arrival and departure and a column to be checked when the dates were estimated (rather than confirmed). As the work progressed, however, this structure quickly came under pressure. The questions posed in our email threads attest to growing issues: what to do if there are more than ten cities visited for a given traveler? What about a traveler who went back to the same city at different, but unclear, times? How to handle multiple spellings of the same city’s name? What can count as an “estimated” date? And again, we came up against the uncertainty of time: what if only an arrival date is known, or if it can only be estimated, or if only the year is indicated? What to do if an entry registers a traveler as “just passing through” somewhere and no year is indicated?</p>\n\n<p>Some of these questions could be easily addressed—or, at least, <em>seemed</em> easy to address initially, such as by adding additional rows or columns to allow for the inputting of more information. Yet new entries often introduced new idiosyncrasies. Even the issues that seemed straightforward began to introduce a level of ambiguity that called into question the soundness of our database structure and how usefully it could serve increasingly complex data. Similar questions cropped up when we turned our attention to retrieving biographical information. The initial database design assumed minimal information collection: a column for the traveler’s name, a column to check to indicate aristocracy and one to indicate gentry, a column for nationality, and a column for expertise/profession. But even this limited scope soon came under pressure: if a traveler’s nationality is not clearly indicated, should they be assumed to be British? What should one do with double titles? And if the person is only given as “probably” X? The system began to look very clunky. Working for a solution with technology colleagues proved difficult: we were not interested in “normalizing” the data in the interest of statistical analysis. But slowly—intent on capturing and representing ambiguities and nuances—we were constructing a new approach to data curation.</p>\n\n<p>It is sobering to remember that we initially expected the creation of a database based on the <em>Dictionary</em>—the entering of basic information regarding the travels and characteristics of travelers—to begin and end in the summer of 2008. When summer was over and the academic year had started with the work far from done, we had to bring on more members of the team to help with the database creation. By October, we had gotten as far as the letter <em>C</em> at one end of the alphabetically organized <em>Dictionary</em> entries, and the letter <em>V</em> at the other. But the complexity of the project had also increased, and the time it was demanding had grown. By February 2010, we were looking for an undergraduate research assistant to help us finish data entry from the <em>Dictionary</em>. We also had enough data to start visualizing it, along with the other projects in Mapping the Republic of Letters.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"experiments-in-visualization\">Experiments in Visualization</h1>\n\n<p>Dynamic data visualizations and the integration of design within humanities research have become hallmarks of the work done under the umbrella of Mapping the Republic of Letters, continuing all the way into <em>A World Made by Travel</em>. When we started the project, extraordinary breakthroughs were already coming to fruition in data-driven computer graphics and dynamic programming languages for browsers.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> The first visualizations dedicated specifically to our Grand Tour data involved working with a GIS or geographic information system, at a time when the application of GIS to history—and digital history in particular—was accelerating and drawing critical reflection. The volume <em>Placing History: How Maps, Spatial Data, and GIS Are Changing Historical Scholarship</em>, edited by Amy Hiller and Anne Kelly Knowles, had recently been published, and we were in conversation with another Stanford lab, the Spatial History Project, where Richard White, Zephyr Frank, and Erik Steiner had led inspiring, collaborative, and innovative research with GIS and dynamic visualizations.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup> For the Grand Tour data, GIS ultimately proved not to be a fit, but as the first visualization we attempted, it represented an important step forward.</p>\n\n<p>Thinking about the tours as routes, and excited about the few thousand travelers for whom we had data, we began to search within the data for “polylines”—lists of points, made of single lines drawn between consecutive points—which form the basis for historical GIS route mapping. The resulting visualization, a mass of lines, was a reality check (see fig 5). This map shows all connected Grand Tour travel data points in “raw trip segments” for the entire eighteenth century superimposed on the Italian Peninsula. It certainly gives a sense of richness of the data set, but it is hard to make sense of beyond that. A viewer wonders what the jumps along a straight line from one place to another could mean, how many travels or travelers it depicts, and what its temporal dimensions are, both for the length of individual travels and for when the travel occurred.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-5.png\" id=\"fig5\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap5&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap5\">\n\nFig. 5. Map visualization of the Grand Tour travel data in which all spatial data that can be organized in terms of place of departure and arrival is connected by the tracing of straight lines (polylines) using GIS.\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The visualization also raised questions about inconsistencies in the data itself. For example, our database organized travel information in terms of time spent in a particular location, with dates marking the beginning and end of the stay; in the case of uncertain records, these at times produced overlapping dates. In terms of GIS, these became negative stays which could not be mapped. Nor did it make sense to see the travels visually resolving in the connection of two destinations when we knew that such a representation was more indicative of missing data than of any actual travel.</p>\n\n<p>The next experiment with GIS visualization focused on travel out of a single destination, as well as on variations in travel patterns over time. Figure 6 shows changes in the destinations of travelers heading out of Florence over different decades. Yet, even in this visualization, questions persisted about what was actually being visualized. For example, Milan might have appeared as a different destination from Bologna, but many would have reached one through the other, making it difficult to count them separately. What the map might show, therefore, had just as much to do with what might have happened in the actual travels as with what was recorded.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-6\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-6.png\" id=\"fig6\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap6&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap6\">\n\nFig. 6. Visualization of Grand Tour travel data for Florence, organized in terms of destinations (which other Italian location is next recorded after Florence for each traveler) and decades of travel (to which timeslice of the eighteenth century the travel record belongs).\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>A subsequent experiment focused on individual, better-known travelers, whose movements were better documented and therefore offered more data. But these remained hard to read, affected still by the straight line that glided over or misrepresented missing data points (fig. 7). Although suggestive for considering multiple travelers together, the visualization did not actually facilitate meaningful comparison between them.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-7\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-7.png\" id=\"fig7\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap7\">\n\nFig. 7. Map visualization of the Grand Tour travel data for six travelers organized in terms of place of arrival and place of departure and connected by the tracing of a straight lines (polylines) using GIS.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Given the problems with visualizing multiple segments of tours for multiple travelers, whether geographically or as vectors, the next and final experiment focused on a distinct and direct route. We picked the route between Rome and Naples because it is well attested and one of the most direct. Figure 8 illustrates combined multiple features: quantity of travelers on this route through time, directions of travel (whether Rome to Naples or Naples to Rome), and a sense of the geographical space. But many questions about its readability lingered: Why was the chart on the map? What meaning did the colors carry? How many travels were depicted?</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-8\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-8.png\" id=\"fig8\" onload=\"resize(this, getElementById(&apos;fig8b&apos;))\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig8b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap8&apos;))\" /> </a> <a name=\"figure-8b\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-8b.png\" id=\"fig8b\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig8&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap8&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap8\">\n\nFig. 8. Map visualization of the Grand Tour travel data for movements between Naples and Rome, aiming to visualize the records for both directions and how the number of recorded journeys increased over time, with each decade represented by a separate line block.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Certainly, there are ways in which GIS can be, and has been, of great use. Ultimately, the Explorer utilizes both a <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/map\">general map</a> showing all the locations attested in the travel data and a minimap accompanying every entry that shows the locations visited by each traveler. Moreover, the place coordinates data is shared along with the rest of the database. Once its gaps and limits are clear, the Explorer travel data can serve as a springboard for gathering additional data—if it is available and sufficient—to enable the tracing of travelers’ routes cartographically. Around this time, Sarah Murray from our team reconstructed the map of the travel of a single tourist (fig. 9), painstakingly using GIS to match all sites mentioned in the travel account published by Richard Colt Hoare on a map of Sicily and thus tracing his tour of the island in 1790.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-9\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-9.png\" id=\"fig9\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap9&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap9\">\n\nFig. 9. Map visualization of Richard Colt Hoare&rsquo;s 1790 tour of Sicily traced through GIS by Sarah Murray and published in her &ldquo;Spatial Analysis and Humanities Data: A Case Study from the Grand Tour Travelers Project,&rdquo; in Jake Coolidge, ed., <i>The CESTA Anthology</i> (Stanford, CA, 2013), 39&ndash;44.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The process required detailed sources that are rarely available and usually only exist for a certain type of traveler, like Hoare, who traveled to Italy with great wealth at his disposal and left an unusually precise account. Even for these travelers, one must go beyond the <em>Dictionary</em> to collect enough data to make it worthwhile to trace locations cartographically with GIS.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup> We simply do not possess the necessary detailed information, inside or outside the <em>Dictionary</em>, for the great majority of travelers. After these first experiments with GIS, we undertook new efforts designed to give us a better handle on our travel data beyond plotting locations in cartographic spaces for which they were a poor fit. For the Grand Tour in particular, given the nature of our data, we soon realized how much our work in visualization needed to be about addressing what was lost, incomplete, and uncertain.</p>\n\n<p>As visualizing the data became a major focus of our efforts, doing so helped us take stock of the vagaries of our source, the <em>Dictionary</em>, and appreciate the fact that much about the majority of these travelers and their journeys has been forgotten or remains altogether unknown—as opposed to the well-known individuals whose travels are well-documented in the <em>Dictionary</em> and beyond. The greatest value of our visualizations lay precisely in their ability to show us the shape as well as the limits of our data, while simultaneously enabling us to look closely at various individual travelers and what the <em>Dictionary</em> recorded about them. Perhaps most important was the realization that even if we were to have many routes traced out on historical maps, this would still not tell us much about the intellectual geography of the Grand Tour—of which the very patterns of what is remembered are also a part. How did the Grand Tour change over this period? What were the variations or overlaps among its individual practitioners? How did these differences or similarities relate to the travelers’ social status, expertise, or gender? These are the questions we need to ask to get at a big picture of the Grand Tour, and these are the questions that have been mostly neglected by a tradition of studies focusing on the most prominent individuals. And these are the questions that would come to animate <em>A World Made by Travel</em>, after first emerging in the form of data questions at early stages in the project.</p>\n\n<p>Visualizations such as figure 10—illustrating patterns in relative prominence among the most visited destinations across the eighteenth century—helped us better grasp the patterns in our data and the overall shape of what was preserved and what was lost.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-10\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-10.png\" id=\"fig10\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap10&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap10\">\n    \nFig. 10.

With this in mind, we devised and developed the prototype for an interactive timeline model for eighteenth-century British and Irish travel to Italy. Figure 11 is a snapshot from our Priestley timechart.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-11\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-11.png\" id=\"fig11\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap11&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap11\">\n\nFig. 11.

The lower band lists visitors to Rome from entries ranging across the full period from 1700 to 1800. However informative, the latter is too dense to make much sense of, though one can select and zoom in on an adjustable shorter span of time, which the upper band then displays.</p>\n\n<p>The origin of the layout here may be Joseph Priestley’s famous <em>Description of a Chart of Biography</em> (1764), but Ben Fry’s <em>The Preservation of Favoured Traces</em> (2009) provided inspiration for the interactivity. Whereas in Priestley’s timeline each line represents a lifespan, every horizontal bar in ours represents the length of a visitor’s stay by place. Priestley published a detailed account of his thinking behind <em>A Chart of Biography</em>, which he advertised as revolutionizing how students learned about history.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> <em>A Chart of Biography</em>, produced in a large format (two feet high by three feet wide), was designed to show a comprehensive view of the lifetimes of historical figures and how they stand in chronological relation to one another. Displaying two thousand lives over a period of three thousand years, Priestley conceived of the graphic chart as ideal for quickly capturing the relative length of the lives and the intervals of time that elapsed between them. All these principles of layout were applicable to how we wanted to explore the Grand Tour travels, although we found it more manageable to filter trips displayed on the timeline by city. In the view for each city, each colored bar represents a traveler known to have visited that city. Each traveler’s bar extends for the amount of time that he or she is known to have been present in the given city. Particularly inspiring was Priestley’s method for showing uncertainty for dates by using a broken line or with dots at the beginning or end of a lifetime when the year is uncertain. We considered implementing a similar gradient to show uncertain start and end dates but ultimately decided against it. To attempt to define an algorithm for each different type and degree of uncertainty in dates could end up being misleading rather than helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Priestley chose the large format size of his printed timeline to match the density of information of his data. At the time we created our timechart, we were working on laptops with only a 1440 x 900 pixel screen resolution and, in our lab, a thirty-inch Apple Cinema Display at 2560 x 1600, which could not accommodate the full scope of travels at once. We took advantage of the digital display to manage the number of trips shown dynamically. We built the Priestley timechart with what was at the time the most sophisticated graphical tool kit for visualization, Protovis. Central to the adaptation to interactive graphics was the “Focus + Context” technique, which made it possible to show the full chart of travels for the entire eighteenth century in a reduced size while using a filter brush to highlight an area for closer inspection in the main view. For example, if one selects the period between January 1748 to January 1753, one sees all the travelers for whom we have entries who were in the selected city at this time, as well as the length of their stay in the city (see fig. 11).</p>\n\n<p>The greatest technical challenge we faced in reproducing the layout for <em>A Chart of Biography</em> was the arrangement of the horizontal bars within the vertical space. Priestley had the advantage of being able to place the lines in his chart by hand, arranging them for maximum density; moreover, he was not tied to an existent set of lives but rather had control and choice of whom to include. For us, committed as we were to include all travelers in the <em>Dictionary</em>, there were no readily available algorithms for the kind of ad hoc modeling of the layout that would also accommodate the various travelers’ name labels. Approximating the effect of <em>A Chart of Biography</em> could not completely avoid the collision of labels and trips.</p>\n\n<p>Fry’s <em>The Preservation of Favoured Traces</em> had only recently been released when we began work on the Priestley timechart. In his project, Fry provided an elegant example of what an interactive graphical interface can bring to the reading of a text with the use of scale. <em>Traces</em> gives an abstract view of the full text of Darwin’s <em>On the Origin of Species</em> (1859), showing the pattern of changes over time from one edition to the next. But what makes it an exciting tool for research and pedagogy is that at any point in the text, you can zoom in to see changes at the level of individual words added and deleted with each edition. We used a similar approach adapted to the character of our underlying text. Since our source was not a monograph but a collection of dictionary entries, the individual travel segment was the point of entry that would first (with a mouseover interaction) give context for that travel segment in the individual’s overall itinerary in Italy as well as the traveler’s name and computed age at the time (fig. 12).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-12\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-12.png\" id=\"fig12\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap12&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap12\">\n\nFig. 12. Screenshot of the interactive Priestley timechart showing how, by hovering on a particular traveler&rsquo;s bar, that traveler&rsquo;s overall itinerary in Italy as well as the traveler&rsquo;s name and computed age at the time appears.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>By clicking on the traveler’s name, one sees the entire text of that traveler’s <i>Dictionary</i> entry (fig. 13).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-13\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-13.png\" id=\"fig13\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap13&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap13\">\n\nFig. 13. Screenshot of the interactive Priestley timechart showing how, by clicking on any traveler&rsquo;s name, in this case Cosmo Alexander, the full text of this traveler&rsquo;s entry in the <i>Dictionary</i> is shown.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>A full-text search of the timechart functions as both a navigation aid and a way to uncover patterns. When typing a traveler’s name in the search box, one sees his or her bar highlighted and immediately gets a sense of who else was in the same city at around the same time and whose trips overlapped. Entering the term <em>architect</em> when looking at travel in Rome highlights the trips made by travelers whose entry includes the term. Though only suggestive, the results reveal significant patterns spread out over the whole century of architects visiting Rome. With the timeline brush, we can narrow that scope to a more detailed exploration of specific periods of time (fig. 14).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-14\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-14.png\" id=\"fig14\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap14&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap14\">\n\nFig. 14. Screenshot of the interactive Priestley timechart showing how, by typing the name of any of the travelers in the search box, the bar representing their travels is highlighted. This also conveys an immediate sense of who else was visiting at the same time. Any word that appears in the entries can be searched in the search box.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>There is a lot that the timechart prototype allows us to see. For example, we could readily appreciate seasonal variation in travel or the change in fortune of individual cities of the Tour over the course of the entire century, and in some cases we could relate these changes to specific types of travelers. For example, there were many architects at Vicenza in the first Palladian-influenced part of the century, while many more went to Naples and Paestum later during the rise of the Greek revival.</p>\n\n<p>Certain characteristics of our data also revealed features and biases of the <em>Dictionary</em>. For example, in the case of travel to Padua, we see a dramatic decline in the number of visits after 1730 (fig. 15).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-15\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-15.png\" id=\"fig15\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap15&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap15\">\n\nFig. 15. Screenshot of our interactive Priestley timechart when searching for Padua, which shows a dramatic decline in records for travels to this location after 1730.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>This visible change is because the visitor register for the city was not well maintained after 1730, a condition of the source materials that would be difficult to track using the <em>Dictionary</em> in its printed format. Even if the preface explains this bias regarding Padua, it would be hard for any reader of the <em>Dictionary</em> to realize its impact while reading through the printed entries without a bird’s-eye view such as that offered by the Priestley timechart. The constant presence of the unknown becomes more evident, measurable, and interpretable in this visualization. (The question of the decline of visits to Padua in the <em>Dictionary</em>’s records has remained an important one through later phases of the Grand Tour work, for which see <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/entering-a-world-made-by-travel#paragraph-42\">Entering a World Made by Travel</a> and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled#paragraph-7\">Sweet</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Searching by person—be it Alexander Cosmo or Philip Stanhope, as shown in figs. 12–14—immediately gives a sense of who else was in Rome around the same time. This view identifies people in the same place at the same time in a way that we would never get from the <em>Dictionary</em>. This loose association among travelers is important because we rarely have an explicit connection mentioned in the entries. This visualization gives us the scope to explore possible relations between travelers who share a spatial and temporal context.</p>\n\n<p>The work done for the Priestley Timechart, even as a prototype, raised new questions about our project as a transformation of a printed reference work into an interactive dynamic digital interface. Such unresolved questions included: How should one make use of the “y” axis? How to deal with uncertainty? Would it be possible to display all the towns at the same time? What would that look like? The timechart also unleashed our imagination and pushed us to think about all sorts of approaches for creating new knowledge out of the data formalized from the print <em>Dictionary</em> text. Once we let go of the tracing of historical routes, we could imagine various ways of connecting the dots between our travelers, including by shared interests, biographical information, dates, and other categories. These were all lines of inquiry that we ended up pursuing later.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"case-study-sixty-nine-british-architects-in-italy\">Case Study: Sixty-Nine British Architects in Italy</h1>\n\n<p>In parallel with the other projects under the Mapping the Republic of Letters umbrella, the next phase involved turning to a focused study that could demonstrate the utility of visualization and data work for making an original contribution to scholarship on the Republic of Letters.<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup> For the Grand Tour, this was a step toward building the Explorer and opening it up to others. We began with a “what” question—“What was the significance of travel to Italy for eighteenth-century British architects?”—to show how historical knowledge and argument can develop out of studying data, but the “how” proved equally consequential. This case study clarified the need to create categories that mediate responsibly between the sources and the research questions, demonstrated the importance of making that process transparent, and showed how insight could be gained by exploring the intersections between data dimensions.</p>\n\n<p>We focused on architects because of my own research familiarity and interest in the topic. My previous work on the history of archaeology in the eighteenth century intersected with these architects. During this time, architects were crucial to the rediscovery, analysis, and representation of ancient classical ruins. They played a distinct role in transforming and disseminating the understanding of ancient material culture that marked the beginning of archaeology as a discipline, and in facilitating the contemporary turn to antiquity characteristic of movements such as new classicism and philhellenism. These architects’ expeditions (today often called “proto-archaeological”)<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> to measure and draw ruins in Rome—and then farther south from Paestum near Naples all the way to Sicily, and even farther afield to Dalmatia, Greece, West Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East—belonged to the tradition of the Grand Tour. At the time, architects were the ones with the skills to visualize the past, and I expected them to inhabit the pages of the <em>Dictionary</em> with thick and meaningful connections. Indeed, the sixty-nine architects of our study allowed for a fresh perspective on both the Grand Tour and on the history of architecture.</p>\n\n<p>The Grand Tour architects case study was published in the <em>American Historical Review</em> in 2017.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup> The article contains the major research findings from the biographical and travel data analyzed and visualized in this study, including the relationships between destination traveled to and publications planned; between the building of expertise and of social networks for future employment; between aspiring professional architects and amateur architects, alongside their differences in status and education, which was also reflected in travel patterns; and between Italy and Britain, where the architects’ travels created a distinct cultural and spatial zone that influenced the dynamics of family generations, personal fortunes, and career trajectories, which would in turn shape the character of British architecture as both a form and a profession. In short, the article constructed a rich picture of architectural history via the collective biography of sixty-nine architects and the subtle intersections of various data dimensions concerning their travels and lives. What I want to focus on here is how this case study transformed our approach to data, by emphasizing categorization as an interpretative act, as well as the importance of making category decisions transparent for every dimension of the data to help facilitate reinterpretation and modification.</p>\n\n<p>Selecting sixty-nine architects for the case study was a process that itself involved interpretation and categorization. The starting point was word searching the entire text of the <em>Dictionary</em> in its digitized version for the word <em>architect</em> (just as in the example discussed above from the Priestley timechart visualization). This search yielded 117 entries. A quick look revealed that many of these travelers were not architects themselves, but their entries contained the term either because they traveled together with architects or encountered architects during their travels. We took note of the networks these occurrences highlighted but excluded these travelers from our data sets. After scrutinizing the 117 entries, we eliminated 47 percent of the original list, trimming it down to sixty-two. The remaining seven architects in our data set are travelers whose <em>Dictionary</em> entries do not contain the term <em>architect</em> but whom we categorized as architects because they featured in another reference work, Howard Colvin’s <em>A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The point might seem obvious but bears elaboration: every inclusion (or exclusion) involves a decision. That is how a data set is constructed and how categories are devised. For the purpose of our study of architects on the Grand Tour, discrepancies among sources are illuminating. Colvin’s work was brought in as the authoritative source on who counts as an architect given his stated goal: Colvin worked tirelessly to identify all the architects he could find, from the famous to the obscure, hunting for architectural drawings in private and public archives. As his research progressed, he expanded the pool in every successive edition from the first in 1954 to the third in 1995.<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> Both Ford and Ingamells, along with their collaborators, knew Colvin’s work well; in fact, it is cited as a source for twenty-one entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> Of course, inclusion as an architect in Colvin but not in Ingamells might be the result of oversight. Still, examining the logic of why some of Colvin’s architects appear in the <em>Dictionary</em> as travelers to Italy without the “architect” label is itself revealing. For example, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">James Byres</a> (1734–1817, travel years 1758–90) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3527\">Alexander Nasmyth</a> (1758–1840, travel years 1783–84) are not listed as architects in the <em>Dictionary</em> because architecture was not as important a component of their time in Italy as other pursuits. Byres traveled to Italy in 1758 to study painting but turned to architecture shortly after his arrival; this venture was also short-lived and occupies just a few lines in his lengthy entry. He soon turned to other activities, becoming the preeminent guide to Roman antiquities for much of his very long time in Italy and playing an essential role as dealer and adviser for Grand Tourists in their many collecting activities. Colvin’s account of Byres focuses on the drawings and the (admittedly few but nonetheless significant) architectural interventions he made once back in Scotland. Alexander Nasmyth identified as a painter, but once back in Scotland—possibly aided by his descent from a family of masons—worked in landscape architecture as well, connecting the work to his expertise in landscape painting. This makes him enough of an architect for Colvin. Counting both Byres and Nasmyth as architects in our study allowed us to tell a larger story about the fluidity of architects’ activities in relation to their Italian travels, as well as how need and circumstances affected professional trajectories.</p>\n\n<p>The addition of three other travelers to our list of architects because of their appearance in Colvin introduces a different issue of categorization. All three have well-documented entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>: <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1814\">Sir Andrew Fountaine</a> (1676–1753, travel years 1702 and 1715–16), <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3548\">Thomas Wynn, 1st Baron Newborough</a> (1736–1807, travel years 1759–60), and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4113\">Hon. Thomas Robinson</a> (1738–86, travel years 1759–61) are typical Grand Tourists—male, elite, and titled. In the <em>Dictionary</em>, they are marked not by any professional association but by their honorifics, family genealogies, Oxbridge affiliations, membership in Parliament, and so forth. Their travels are varied and well-attested, rich in connections and tourist activities, such as posing for portraits, socializing, and commissioning and collecting art—activities that also evinced an interest in architecture. They appear in Colvin because of their influential roles in the history of architecture and the attestation of surviving drawings: Fountaine seems to have planned the addition of a library and music room to his estate; in Wynn’s case, drawings survive attesting to some ability as an amateur architect for his own family seat and that of his brother-in-law; and Robinson planned fortifications against French invasions and other buildings on his own land.</p>\n\n<p>For each of these three, Colvin uses the term <em>amateur architect</em>, a term he himself problematized in the 1993 essay “What We Mean by Amateur.”<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> Attempting a definition and an explanation, Colvin stated that the three most reliable criteria identifying an amateur architect are that they are not remunerated for their practice, might not be able to draw the plans themselves (hiring others in part or in full), and would not be involved in the drawings’ actual execution. He concluded also that he would prefer the term <em>gentleman architect</em> as more precise and to avoid the anachronistic use of <em>amateur</em>, which was not included in the original eighteenth-century <em>Dictionary</em> by Samuel Johnson, coming into use only after architecture as a profession was well-established. Certainly, it is as “gentlemen” tourists that these travelers appear in the <em>Dictionary</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Colvin’s discussion demonstrates categorization as an active interpretive process, one all the more charged when dealing with a historical context in which new definitions are emerging. Professional and institutional recognition was an explicit goal for architects in the eighteenth century—John Soane (1753–1837, travel years 1778–80) titled his 1835 autobiography <em>Memoirs of the Professional Life of an Architect</em>—that was resolved only in the early nineteenth century. The biographies populating Colvin’s <em>BDBA</em> tell this history of professionalization, serving as its very <em>data</em>. Colvin had to make choices about whom to include and on what grounds, while also creating distinctions like that of “amateur” architect; the preface reads as both an explanation of his approach and a summary of the professionalization of architectural practice. In our case study, we explored architects and the Grand Tour by letting the data tell the story. We were following and deepening the same impulse that governed earlier biographical dictionaries, revealing a sense of narrative continuity attached to the data and its previous researchers.</p>\n\n<p>These efforts around categorization continued to influence decisions concerning what information to formalize about these sixty-nine architects and how to organize it. We had been collecting data about travelers from the very beginning of the project, but for these sixty-nine, we had a specific focus and research question to explore. This meant that we extended the scope of data collection beyond the <em>Dictionary</em>, which made us all the more aware of its particularities.</p>\n\n<p>We organized the collection of biographical information around three basic data points: name, unique identifier (ID) number, and professionalization status. For all sixty-nine architects, we recorded a personal name (in two cases just a last name, as preserved in the <em>Dictionary</em>) and assigned an ID number, a crucial step for systematizing any data set. For each of them, we also recorded whether they were an “amateur architect,” resulting in a column in the database with a yes/no value. There are twelve “amateur architects” in the database; six are termed as such in the <em>Dictionary</em>, while another three we recovered from Colvin’s <em>BDBA</em>, as discussed previously. Three more are termed “architects” in the <em>Dictionary</em>, but we coded them as “amateur architects” based on how Colvin presents their work in his <em>BDBA</em>. For example, Colvin reported that Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington, an influential patron and arbiter of architectural taste, “can draw and design as well as pay the bill.” Of Thomas Hope, Colvin states he was “a competent draughtsman but as an amateur architect he confined himself to his own two houses.”<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Building on this base structure, we collected data in four major fields: (1) education, (2) affiliations with academies and societies, (3) occupations and posts, and (4) funding sources—all drawn from both our <em>Dictionary</em> and Colvin’s. Populating these four fields with data involved distinct exercises in categorization. For “education,” the data includes seventeen different “Educational Institutions”; making sense of this variety in a manner that would speak to our research question required creating the new category of “Educational Background,” in which individual institutions are grouped under three headings: “Art Schools” (five instances), “Other Universities and Colleges” (also five), and “Oxbridge and Inns of Court” (seven). The further heading of “Training with an Individual” was created to represent all nineteen instances where apprenticeships with specific artists and architects are mentioned in either Colvin or the Grand Tour <em>Dictionary</em>. Similarly, to make sense of the eighteen architect-affiliated societies and academies that varied in terms of their absolute membership size, establishment dates, and geographic location necessitated the additional category “Societies and Academies by Type,” with four headings under it: “British Artist Societies” (seven instances), “British Learned Societies” (four), “Italian Societies” (four), and “Other National Societies” (three). For the field “Employments and Appointments,” the four subcategories created were “Official Architecture,” which covered all cases found of remunerated architectural work, private or institutional, including service on committees for public work; “MP,” for members of Parliament; “Knight,” for architects who were knighted at some point; and “Military,” for those who served in the military.</p>\n\n<p>The last field, concerning information about the economics of travel, was harder to formalize. It did not rely as directly on information already structured or semistructured in either Colvin or the <em>Dictionary</em>. The category of “Funding Sources” represents a crystallization of what we gathered from Colvin and the <em>Dictionary</em> about how architects financed their tours. Out of a variety of mentions and passing references, we came to appreciate how sometimes architects traveled to Italy thanks to sponsors—whether by their own family firms or private sponsors—and also how taking commissions during their travels served as a form of support. Other funding sources included a few emerging scholarships and their own private wealth, whether inherited or secured from an already-established architectural practice. Five headings were created for this: “Commissioned Work” (counting twenty-two architects), “Independent Wealth” (twenty-one), “Private Sponsorship” (five), “Architectural Family Business” (three), and “Scholarship” (two).</p>\n\n<p>As for formalizing the architects’ travels as data, from the very beginning of our data collection from the <em>Dictionary</em>, the basic format had centered on time and place—specifically, when a traveler had visited a place. We had to distinguish conceptually between “tour” and “trips,” where the former references the whole journey through Italy, and the latter references its segments, visits to particular places. Given that the most common format in the <em>Dictionary</em> would be when a traveler arrived and when a traveler left a place, this needed to be the model: recording for each location a time of arrival and departure, even if a component was missing. We attributed unique identifiers to each trip (segments with a place and time), as well as to each place. For the sixty-nine architects, we have 626 trips and 130 places documented, the latter with georeferenced data; this was the data used for the architects’ case study visualizations and made available for downloading.</p>\n\n<p>While sixty-nine is a larger number of individuals than would usually occupy books on the history of eighteenth-century British architecture, it is not a large cohort. As with any small but thick data set, however, visualizations help clarify on many levels the bigger picture: the individuals and the various patterns emerging from the many dimensions and their intersections. The interactive graph and map visualizations—built in Palladio and custom made to display, peruse, and probe the data—allow readers to seek particular information about both individual architects and societies; additionally, aggregated trends emerge from exploring these visualizations further. The videos explain how we designed these visualizations and what we learned from our visual explorations of the data.</p>\n\n<p>The first video illustrates the map we built in Palladio to show the architects’ travels together with a timespan filter that allows viewers to explore various dimensions of the travel data (video 1). The map on top gives an immediate sense of where the sixty-nine architects traveled; all destinations in the data appear on the map as dots, covering most but not all of Italy (note the much more sparsely covered South) and expanding beyond Italy to places like Spalato on the other side of the Adriatic coast and Athens, as well as to locations in Asia and North Africa. The map also visualizes quantitative information: the dots are sized to represent the number of visits to each destination (the more visited the place, the larger the dot), and hovering over them displays the place name and the number of architects recorded in our data who traveled there.</p>\n\n<video width=\"640\" height=\"480\" controls=\"\">\n  <source src=\"/assets/videos/video1.mp4\" />\n  <track label=\"English\" kind=\"subtitles\" srclang=\"en\" src=\"/assets/videos/video1.vtt\" default=\"\" />\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n<figure>\n<figcaption>\nVideo 1.

Hovering over a line reveals the name of the relevant architect; these lines become readable as marks of individuals. Moreover, the interactive aspect of this visualization extends to the relationship between the map and the timeline below it: if a viewer selects a section of the timeline, only the travels relevant to that slice of time appear on the map above it. Viewers can run through the timeline across the entire century, watching the animation show who traveled where, with many dots appearing and disappearing, becoming larger or smaller, in a reflection of travel trends over time.</p>\n\n<p>We also built a custom-made timechart visualization for the architects’ travels because there was more that we wanted to visualize about the data than the map with a time filter allowed. In particular, we wanted to compare the architects’ travels in terms of both destinations visited and time spent in these places. We wanted to be able to see the data about place and time of travel simultaneously, appreciate the travels of any single architect in relation to those of the others, and identify the overall patterns that might emerge for the whole group of architects’ travels across the century. Additionally, we wanted to incorporate some biographical data into this visualization so that we might explore emerging trends and their meaning. With this in mind, we built a timechart in which the travels of all sixty-nine architects appear as color-coded bars along with additional data (video 2).</p>\n\n<video width=\"640\" height=\"480\" controls=\"\">\n  <source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"/assets/videos/video2.mp4\" />\n  <track label=\"English\" kind=\"subtitles\" srclang=\"en\" src=\"/assets/videos/video2.vtt\" default=\"\" />\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n<figure>  \n<figcaption>\nVideo 2.

Interactive timechart available at <a href=\"http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/publications/grandtour/timechart/\">http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/publications/grandtour/timechart/</a>.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The first noticeable characteristic of this visualization is the choice that we made to let go of cartographic representation for the travel data. We adopted that in the Palladio map, but here it didn’t serve our purposes. This abandonment of the map was true also of the Priestley timechart, but that chart featured horizontal bars showing who was in the same place at the same time. For the timechart of architects’ travels, the focus was rather on duration of stays and variety of travel destinations. Note that all 130 destinations are still represented, albeit with a different principle than their geographical coordinates. When viewers type the name of a location in the search box, only the relevant travel segments are activated; for example, when typing “Florence,” only the orange bars pertaining to travel to Florence for all the architects will appear. Moreover, hovering over the bars displays precise details for each stay in Florence. For example, for John Talman, the first architect traveling in the eighteenth century in our database, viewers will see his first stay in Florence dated November 18, 1709, to April 1710; the second January 1722; and the third July to October 1715.</p>\n\n<p>At first, we expected to mark each of the 130 locations in our data in a different color to emphasize the variety in travel destinations, but we soon realized that such a chart would be unreadable. It became necessary to group locations under a number of visually effective colors. These groupings in turn afforded us additional layers of meaning. The chart’s final version uses thirteen different colors to which each of the 130 locations is assigned. Ten of these colors represent the ten independent states into which eighteenth-century Italy was divided. Scholars of preunification Italy have to remind their readers and interlocutors again and again that up until 1860, Italy was subdivided into a myriad of independent states. Print books contain maps to convey this political reality and often give multiple maps because some boundaries were redrawn several times over the course of the eighteenth century. By dividing our travel locations into colors pertaining to different eighteenth-century Italian states, we managed to convey this historical reality while circumventing the issue of the fluidity of certain regional boundaries. For six of the states, we also created a darker shade to indicate the capital city. In addition, our data includes the category of vicinity, which uses the same darker shade as the capitals in nearby locations. This avoids distorting the reality that most Grand Tourists had long stays in the main Italian cities from which they completed (and recorded) day trips to local destinations. We didn’t want our color coding to misrepresent these excursions—misleadingly indicating travel far into the Kingdom of Naples, for instance, when most travelers by and large did not venture much farther south than the Neapolitan region. Three additional colors stand for categories that are crucial for understanding travel patterns in the world of the Grand Tour. First, we assigned beige to all instances of travel where we know the tourist was in Italy but with no further specification of visited places, such as for most of John Groves’s travels. Second, we assigned gray to all destinations beyond the Italian Peninsula. These range from faraway locales such as Constantinople and Greece and Malta to closer ones like Spalato and Pola. While the latter two would technically be considered part of the Venetian Republic, we marked them separately given the special bureaucratic and logistical efforts necessary to visit. Sicily received its own category colored in brown: the island was politically part of the Kingdom of Naples for most (but not all) of the century, yet it stood separate in the habits and imaginations of eighteenth-century travelers. By clicking on the color tabs at the bottom of the visualizations, each indicating the name of its region, viewers see only the relevant destinations highlighted, an interactive feature that allows the appreciation of distinct travel trends in each of the groupings we created.</p>\n\n<p>Several measures of time—in addition to the aforementioned dates appearing when viewers hover over the bars—are included in the timechart of travelers, showing both the place and date of each segment of travel. On the left side of the chart, the architects’ names are listed from top to bottom in the chronological order under which their travels occurred. Additionally, at the beginning of each travel bar is the first year of travel: for John Talman, the first traveler in our data set, this date is the year 1699, and for Charles Tatham, the last architect traveling in the century, it is 1794. We listed decades to the left of the names in a column, placing them next to the first traveler in that decade. This helps readily identify at which point in the century a traveler is located and the density of travelers per decade. Therefore, viewers can discern immediately that the 1750s and 1760s were the two most traveled periods, each counting twelve architects.</p>\n\n<p>We also wanted to give a sense of travel durations. Similar to what we had done for colors, we had to make adjustments given the disparities in what is recorded. For some destinations we knew how many days a traveler stayed; for others we could merely approximate the months in which they visited. In the end, to maintain graph legibility, we chose the month as the minimum unit of measure; that is, whether one stay amounted to a day or a month, it would take up the same portion of the bar. Here there is inevitably a distortion; for example, we know that Reveley spent from the end of February to the end of March in 1784 touring Puglia, but because his detailed records list as many as fourteen destinations, his trip is depicted as longer than a year. The marking at intervals of twelve at the bottom of the visualization precisely represents months and years only when the accuracy of the data allows (which is not typically the case, a fact that needs to be taken into account). At the bottom of the visualization is a bar marking intervals of twelve; these are to be understood only as <em>approximations</em> of months, since often the minimum measure of one month per location throws off accuracy. Given that each architect’s travels are represented in a single row, two measures for which the bars do not necessarily allow easy reading are the number of destinations reached by an individual traveler and whether a traveler undertook multiple tours. These are represented, instead, by two more marks: parentheses following the traveler’s name contain the numbers of places visited, and a dot following the traveler’s name indicates that the traveler took multiple trips to Italy.</p>\n\n<p>We created two more interactive features to clarify understanding and add further meaning to the bar chart. First, when viewers click on any name, they deactivate the relevant bar. We included this so that viewers could select which travel bars to view more easily; for example, it is easier to compare the two Mylne brothers’ strips after deselecting the trips of Byres, Newborough, and Hadfield. Also, when one clicks the “highlight amateur” box, the twelve amateur architects appear bolded, distinguished from the others so that viewers can appreciate at once how amateur trips differed from professional ones in terms of places visited.</p>\n\n<p>We also used Palladio to build interactive data visualizations for the architects’ biographical data. For the education data we built an interactive graph to visualize the seventeen different “Educational Institutions” that are recorded in our architects’ database (video 3).</p>\n\n<video width=\"640\" height=\"480\" controls=\"\">\n  <source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"/assets/videos/video3.mp4\" />\n  <track label=\"English\" kind=\"subtitles\" srclang=\"en\" src=\"/assets/videos/video3.vtt\" default=\"\" />\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n<figure>\n<figcaption>\nVideo 3. Palladio interactive graph for the architects&rsquo; education data. Interactive graph available at <a href=\"http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/publications/grandtour/education/\">http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/publications/grandtour/education/</a>.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>One of these “Educational Institutions”—the Royal Academy Schools—was attended by seven different architects, while eight other institutions appear only once. Most institutions are British, but five are Continental, and one is American (Harvard College). In one case, we have only “Oxford,” with no mention of a particular college. To make sense of this variety in a manner that would speak to our research question, we created the new category (and new column) of “Educational Background,” into which we grouped the seventeen individual institutions under three headings: “Art Schools” (five instances), “Other Universities and Colleges” (also five), and “Oxbridge and Inns of Court” (seven). We also added a heading, “Training with an Individual,” to represent the nineteen instances where apprenticeships with specific artists and architects are mentioned in either Colvin or the <em>Dictionary</em>. While we have records of specific institutions attended for only twenty-six architects, by taking into account the “Training with Individual” educational background, we gain educational knowledge for another thirteen of them.</p>\n\n<p>We created a graph to display and explore the educational data using an interactive visualization that allows readers to probe a number of possible associations. One can zoom in to analyze individual architects’ educational paths and to look for aggregated trends. For example, if you click on Thomas Hardwick’s name, you see that he both attended an art school and trained with an individual. If you zoom on his name in the graph, you notice that the same is true of another four architects (George Hadfield, Willey Reveley, Joseph Michael Gandy and Thomas Johnson). Also, it appears that there is only one other case of an architect with two educational backgrounds: James Gibbs, who both trained with an individual and attended one of the universities and colleges in the data set. Interacting with the graph, viewers can easily grasp that we have an educational background for three-quarters of the amateur architects compared to less than half (47.3 percent) of the professional architects; yet, for the latter, we have representation of all four types of educational background, while for the amateurs, we see only two (the socially elite “Oxbridge and Inns of Courte” and “Other Colleges and Universities”).</p>\n\n<p>We built another Palladio interactive graph for our data concerning architects’ affiliations to various associations related to their architectural interests and pursuits (video 4).</p>\n\n<video width=\"640\" height=\"480\" controls=\"\">\n  <source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"/assets/videos/video4.mp4\" />\n  <track label=\"English\" kind=\"subtitles\" srclang=\"en\" src=\"/assets/videos/video4.vtt\" default=\"\" />\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n<figure>\n<figcaption>\nVideo 4. Interactive Palladio graph visualization of architects&rsquo; societies and academies data. Interactive graph available at <a href=\"http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/publications/grandtour/societies/\">http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/publications/grandtour/societies/</a>.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Drawing from both Colvin and the <em>Dictionary</em>, we have records for eighteen such societies and academies in the database. These vary in terms of their membership size and dates of establishment—both of which in turns affect how to consider the number of their attestations among our architects—and geographic location. The most prominent in our data is the Society of Antiquaries (founded in 1707 and continuing today), with fourteen affiliates among our architects. The next most prominent, with twelve affiliates, is the Society of Artists (1760–91), followed by both the Royal Academy (established in 1768 and continuing today) and the Architects’ Club (founded in 1792 and active until around 1830), with eleven affiliates. Six societies count only one affiliate. Among the non-British societies, the Accademia Clementina di Bologna (1710–1803) is the most prominent with four affiliates. In order to make this variety speak to our research question, we created an additional category (and a new column) with four types of societies and academies. All eighteen individual associations appear in the column “Societies and Academies by Name,” but in the column “Societies and Academies by Type,” they are consolidated under four headings: seven in “British Artist Societies,” four in “British Learned Societies,” four in “Italian Societies,” and three in “Other National Societies.” For twenty-seven architects, we have no records of any affiliation, but for just over three-fifths of the whole set we do, and in particular we know that twenty-six were associated with “British Artist Societies,” nineteen with “British Learned Societies,” fifteen with “Italian Societies,” and two with “Other National Societies”—the last two being William Chambers and Andrew Fountaine, respectively, associated with Berlin Academy for Fountaine and both the Swedish and French one for Chambers.</p>\n\n<p>The interactive graph we built in Palladio to display, peruse, and probe the data allows readers to seek particular information about both individual architects and societies. Additionally, aggregated trends emerge from exploring the graph further. William Chambers quickly appears as the only one to populate all four subcategories of “Academies and Societies,” followed by three others—George Dance the Younger, Robert Mylne, and Robert Adam—who appear to populate as many as three categories (and they all miss the same fourth of “Other National Societies”). These four architects who hold the most different types of affiliations are all among the better-known architects of eighteenth-century Britain. But understanding the data means that we have to remember that John Talman, whose only affiliation is to British Learned Societies (the Academy of Virtuosi in particular), traveled and lived in the early eighteenth century, before any of the British Art Societies in our data set existed. With this caveat, it is even more telling that in the case of the eighteen who have only one type of affiliation, nine are affiliated with one of the British Art Societies, six with one of the Italian Societies, and three  with one of the British Learned Societies. For all of the ten architects who count two types of affiliation, one of these affiliations is with a British Art Society. In the interactive graph, it is easier to appreciate significant differences between amateurs and professionals. One can see how proportionally we have a similar amount of data in this case for both (respectively 58.33 percent for amateurs, 61.4 percent for professionals) but also that all the amateurs together populate only two subcategories; in fact, were it not for Andrew Fountaine’s lone affiliation with “Other National Academies,” they would all belong to just one, “British Learned Societies.” These quantitative measures of the data speak to the stories of professionalization and social dynamics that we discuss in the <em>AHR</em> article.</p>\n\n<p>We built another Palladio interactive graph visualization about the employments and appointments of our architects, based on data that we formalized mostly from free text (video 5). In reading and rereading the architects’ biographical snapshots, we discovered categories recurrent across enough multiple entries to be meaningful for our understanding of the lives of these travelers as they intersected with both professional ventures and amateur interests in architecture. We started taking notes on instances of architects who were compensated when hired by an institution, such as the office of works, whether to serve on committees or to oversee commissions or construction of buildings. We discovered references to architects who were appointed as members of Parliament, who served in the military, and who received a knighthood. In the <em>Dictionary</em>, much of this information appeared in an organized way, often including a defining term and a date, while Colvin’s references were in more discursive form. The variety was extensive, with fewer cues for formalizing these informational categories. To capture this newfound wealth of information, we created the category “Employments and Appointments” and grouped this data into four subcategories: Official Architecture, MP, Knight, and Military. “Official Architecture”—under which we grouped all cases we found of remunerated architectural work, be it private or institutional, including serving on committees for public work—was the most populated. We have this data for thirty architects, a significant number. For the other subcategories under “Employments and Appointments,” we count seven architects in “MP” (“Member of Parliament”), six for “Knight,” and five for “Military.”</p>\n\n<video width=\"640\" height=\"480\" controls=\"\">\n  <source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"/assets/videos/video5.mp4\" />\n  <track label=\"English\" kind=\"subtitles\" srclang=\"en\" src=\"/assets/videos/video5.vtt\" default=\"\" />\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n<figure>\n<figcaption>\nVideo 5. Interactive Palladio graph visualization of architects&rsquo; employments and appointments data. Interactive graph available at <a href=\"http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/publications/grandtour/employments/\">http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/publications/grandtour/employments/</a>.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Once again, the graph allows researchers to explore individuals’ trajectories and to visualize aggregate trends. For example, the graph reveals that Edward Lovett Pearce is the only architect to populate all four subcategories—appearing in “Official Architecture,” “MP,” “Knight,” and “Military.” Among the amateurs, not even one appears in “Official Architecture,” in line with how Colvin described amateurs as those who did not provide their services for compensation. Amateurs dominate the other subcategories. They comprise five of the seven MPs, meaning that 41 percent of the 12 amateurs architects were MPs versus 3.5 percent of professional architects. The two professionals here are Robert Adam, famous for his successful social advancement through architecture, and Pearce, a member of the Irish Parliament. Knighthood was more common as a recognition of extraordinary service for professional architects. Here, while the amateurs still dominate proportionally (16 percent versus 7 percent), we have a majority of professionals (Chambers, Soane, Taylor, and, once again, Pearce). Yet only the amateur Lord Burlington was elected a Knight of a chivalric order—that of the Garter; the rest were elected to knighthood recognizing their service as architects. Among the five architects counted under “Military,” three are amateurs and two professionals. Pearce is one of these two, while the other is Stephen Riou, who trained as an architect after a military career. Pearce does not appear in Colvin on account of his being an Irishman, and his distinctiveness in crossing the amateur and professional boundary in a number of ways might be related to that unique national context.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we built a Palladio interactive visualization for the architects’ funding data (video 6). The information in this graph regarding the economics of the architects’ travels was the most challenging to formalize. “Funding Sources” represents our own crystallizations of what we gathered from Colvin and the <em>Dictionary</em> about how architects financed their tours. Out of a variety of mentions and passing references, we came to appreciate that architects sometimes traveled to Italy thanks to sponsors—whether their own family firms or private sponsors—but also that taking commissions during their travels served as a form of support. Other funding sources included a few emerging scholarships and private wealth, be this inherited or secured from an already-established architectural practice. We were able to collect funding source information for fifty-two of the architects.</p>\n\n<video width=\"640\" height=\"480\" controls=\"\">\n  <source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"/assets/videos/video6.mp4\" />\n  <track label=\"English\" kind=\"subtitles\" srclang=\"en\" src=\"/assets/videos/video6.vtt\" default=\"\" />\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n<figure> \n<figcaption>\nVideo 6. Interactive Palladio graph visualization of architects&rsquo; funding sources data. Interactive graph available at <a href=\"http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/publications/grandtour/funding/\">http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/publications/grandtour/funding/</a>.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The formalized category of “Funding Sources” contains five subcategories. Almost equally represented are “Commissioned Work,” which we have for twenty-two architects, and “Independent Wealth,” which we have for twenty-one. These two groupings would seem diametrically opposed, but in fact there is overlap in four cases. More expected are the instances of overlap between “Commissioned Work” and “Private Sponsorship” (of which there are five); between “Commissioned Work” and “Architectural Family Business” (three); and two cases in which “Private Sponsorship,” “Architectural Family Business,” and “Commission Work” all appear. “Private Sponsorship” appears alone six times and once joined with “Architectural Family Business,” which also appears on its own another six times. There are only two instances of “Scholarship,” both of which appear together with “Commissioned Work.”</p>\n\n<p>In the interactive graph, once again, it is easier to explore the “Funding Sources” data and tease out the stories, both individual and aggregated, that the data holds. For example, as mentioned before, in sorting and visualizing, readers can see that all but one of the amateurs funded their travels by way of “Independent Wealth.” They can also see that in the case of the lone exception, Sir Andrew Fountaine, we do not have an alternative data point but rather an absence of information. The narratives and insights that we argued for in the <em>AHR</em> article—about the professionalization of eighteenth-century architecture and its relation to Italian travel, and about the social and family dynamics of these transformations—are all grounded in the data we collected on the sixty-nine architects who traveled to Italy that comprise our data set. The interactive graphs we built are exploratory, helping us—and readers—to visualize and process the sorting, counting, and combining of the categories we created. Despite appearances, these graphs do the work of grouping and sorting, not network analysis. Yet one limitation is that the graphs are not multinodal, which would quickly become unreadable even with our small absolute numbers. Each of the four graphs we built privileges a category and then adds other dimensions for additional sorting. Thus, we made the choice to privilege, in turn, the four main data categories (“Education,” “Societies,” “Employments and Appointments,” and “Funding”) and the ability to sort all of these by “amateur” and an additional category; for example, if you click on “amateur” when looking at funding sources, only the nodes relevant to the twelve amateurs will appear.</p>\n\n<p>Many insights crucial to the arguments we made in the <em>AHR</em> article emerged from these dynamic visualizations. In one such discovery with the timechart—combining travel destinations, timing, and travelers—the rise of the Doric revival was literally made visible as architects rediscovered the Greek style in ruins they explored at Paestum and further south in the Neapolitan Kingdom, all the way to Sicily. Conversely, we could see how the Palladian style—for which Veneto was an important destination—became less prominent over the course of the century, with the notable exception of William Mylne’s travels (which indicate also sibling bond and rivalry, as he went solo to the Veneto region, in contrast to the southern and more expansive trajectory undertaken by his more successful brother). Here we also began to discern, indirectly, a map of architects’ publication projects by who traveled beyond Italy in search of unpublished monuments and ruins. The timechart also visually revealed differences between the travels of amateurs (bars with shorter and more colorful segments) and of professionals (bars dominated by long red segments and overall fewer colors). This speaks to how amateurs, more like typical elite Grand Tourists, spent less time traveling overall but visited a more varied assortment of places and often returned to Italy for additional tours. All these findings are discussed at length in the <em>AHR</em> article, but what is relevant here is the importance of dynamic graphs, timelines, and charts in visualizing travel data and enabling historiographical argumentation about it.</p>\n\n<p>Through this case-study publication, we also experimented with and learned how best to share data. The Stanford Digital Repository (SDR) became available in 2005, just a few years before Mapping the Republic of Letters started its work, and we deposited all data there (<a href=\"https://purl.stanford.edu/ct765rs0222\">https://purl.stanford.edu/ct765rs0222</a>), alongside our data schema (<a href=\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:zk774hr3012/schema.pdf\">https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:zk774hr3012/schema.pdf</a>), in order to be accountable and helpful to any scholars who might be interested in using it. We proceeded to create an interactive visualization tool dedicated solely to showing the “shape of the data” and, in particular, to what data was missing. This tool was <a href=\"http://hdlab.stanford.edu/breve/\">Breve</a>, and like Palladio, it is still available today. The table viewer in Breve allows viewers to see at once all the major data points we have for the architects—the 69 people, the 130 places, and the 620 trips in our database—together with their unique identifiers (IDs) and their various dimensions (each in itself a datapoint). With Breve, it is possible to visually represent missing data in a data set so as to adjust expectations. For the architect data, viewers can see not only how certain dimensions are fully represented (this is the case for the architect names as well as for the IDs and any other categories we assigned ourselves, such as whether or not we considered the architects to be amateurs), but also where the gaps are, especially in the biographical information.</p>\n\n<p>On the project website, readers of the AHR article could also access the data itself; they could read about the rationale for its shape and organization in the schema, interact with the dynamic visualizations, and download the data to address their own questions or interests. Shortly after publication, a digital humanities center in another country—the Digital Humanities group at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento, Italy—reached out to share their own visualizations of our architect data, which they had drawn from the Stanford Digital Repository—further proof, for us, of the new kinds of scholarly dialogue made possible by data-driven humanities (see fig. 16).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-16\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-16.png\" id=\"fig16\" onload=\"resize(this, getElementById(&apos;fig16&apos;))\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig16&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap16&apos;))\" /> </a> <a name=\"figure-16b\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-15b.png\" id=\"fig16b\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig16b&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap16&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap16\">\n\nFig. 16.

But the experience of tracing a full arc from data collection to publication deeply transformed our overall approach, informing how we went about the digital transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em> and ultimately inspiring the creation of the Grand Tour Explorer.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-explorer\">The Explorer</h1>\n\n<p>The case study of sixty-nine architects demonstrated how visualizations could be a means of exploring and revealing irregularities and missing dimensions in the data in such a way as to develop insights and arguments about it. It also made it possible to address concerns about the <em>Dictionary</em> data lacking integrity; even this could be visualized and analyzed. While it became clear that there would never be “complete” data, we discovered what we <em>could</em> achieve by understanding the data’s shape, with even its uneven or missing bits telling a story. Furthermore, what we learned in working with the architects’ data—which we had transformed by adding our own categories and additional information from other sources—is that other scholars would likely work in a similar way with our <em>Dictionary</em> data, transforming or adding to it according to their own research questions. Moving on from the question of data integrity per se—no historical record is ever complete—we recognized that what we most needed was to ensure integrity and transparency in our database construction.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"algorithms-for-parsing\">Algorithms for Parsing</h2>\n\n<p>Achieving integrity and transparency would mean harnessing technologies, but making this computational turn was possible only because of our accumulated understanding of the print <em>Dictionary</em> and its entries. That much of the <em>Dictionary</em> consisted of semistructured information ripe for a data approach had been the originating impulse for the project. But only by systematically poring over the sixty-nine architects’ entries did a deep sense of the structural relations and repeated patters among entries emerge. With this impression of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s “grammar” in place, it was then possible to craft algorithms—sets of rules—to teach the computer how to parse the text and retrieve information that could be formalized as data. Parsing meant teaching the computer to read the <em>Dictionary</em> through its structural regularities. This resulting approach was much more systematic than could be hoped from a purely manual method. Each new data search and retrieval could be run through the entirety of the <em>Dictionary</em>. It became possible to add cumulatively and organically—especially as new layers of data to be extracted appeared—but in a manner that adjusted the new findings across the database, ensuring a consistency that no one had been able to maintain manually. This was an iterative approach. The machine could learn to complete the work effectively and quickly with an accuracy of about 90 percent in each case—only occasionally running into a feature that was beyond what the algorithm had taken into account. It was, again and again, the human eye that caught the mistake and worked to bridge this last 10 percent and achieve accuracy and meaningful consistency. However, where the computer could parse the entire <em>Dictionary</em> in a few minutes, the human reading and checking was much slower and would lead to further iterations of machine parsing.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In this way, step-by-step, the work of transforming the printed <em>Dictionary</em> pages into the database at the heart of the Grand Tour Explorer was completed. The computer ensuring consistency proved essential. But the human work of formalizing the data retrieval logic and verifying consistency was equally essential. This proved to be necessary for operations ranging from formalizing dates of birth to formalizing processes that added data dimensions that might not be as explicitly manifest, such as gender. All these steps entailed decisions about category representation, as well as about how to deal with multilayered sources, themselves the result of earlier scholarly decisions about what information to preserve and how. The integrity of this process and of the decision-making underlying it were tantamount to the integrity of the database itself.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the Paul Mellon Centre for British Arts in London, I had a CD-ROM copy of the <em>Dictionary</em> that represented exactly what had appeared in print originally. We transferred this document into a plaintext file ready for analysis. The plaintext file was stripped of all font formatting (such as bold or italics), but it preserved spacing, capitalization, and essential punctuation marks, such as parentheses and dashes (fig. 17).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-17\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-17.png\" id=\"fig17\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap17&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap17\">\n    \nFig. 17. From print to text file: the transformation of the <i>Dictionary</i> entries&rsquo; text into a format that we could computationally parse.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Once we had the text in this format, the next step was to teach the computer to use a combination of Regular Expression and ad hoc scripts to construct the database. The first step was for the computer to “chunk” the text into individual entries and then to further subdivide them into major components. We designed an algorithm that taught the computer to recognize entries by identifying their headings—that is, to look for words (the persons’ names) appearing in all-capitals and followed by a line break, since the <em>Dictionary</em> included spaces between separate entries. Each of the entries identified thus was assigned a unique ID number. Next, the computer was taught to segment entries by their major structural parts, parts by now long familiar to us: (1) the biographical, which is all the text found adjacent to the headings until the first paragraph break; (2) the travels, which is the next paragraph containing the dates and places of the tours and recognizable also because it always begins with the four digits of the initial travel year; (3) the narrative, which is the continuous prose text extending for one or more paragraphs following the line break after the travels paragraph; and (4) the notes, which make up the section following the narrative prose paragraphs and is identifiable because it always begins with the numeral “1” in reference to the first textual note (see fig. 18).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-18\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-18.png\" id=\"fig18\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap18&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap18\">\n    \nFig. 18. The &ldquo;chunking&rdquo; of a sample <i>Dictionary</i> entry into four major components: (1) the biographical information, (2) the travels, (3) the narrative, and (4) the notes.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Once the <em>Dictionary</em>’s text was divided according to this consistently applied structure, the focus of the next phase was the retrieval of data from the first two parts—the biography and the travels—again using a combination of Regular Expression and ad hoc scripts. This meant teaching the computer what to look for and what to extract over various repeated runs so that, bit by bit, different parts of the starting text became the organized, transformed data.</p>\n\n<p>Within the biographical information section, the process depended on our recognition that parentheses, commas, and semicolons distinguished discrete information types. Once this was understood, we were able to design rules to teach the computer to separate them accordingly, transforming the extracted biography from layout A into layout B (fig. 19).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-19\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-19.png\" id=\"fig19\" onload=\"resize(this, getElementById(&apos;fig19b&apos;))\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig19b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap19&apos;))\" /> </a> <a name=\"figure-19b\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-19b.png\" id=\"fig19b\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig19b&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap19&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap19\">\n\nFig. 19. The biographical information from a sample entry separated into discrete elements by our algorithm using commas and semicolons as reference.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>From there, the gathering of biographical data began. The algorithm told the computer to pluck out all sets of two four-digit numbers separated by an en-dash appearing within parentheses and to place the first year as the traveler’s birth date and the second as the death date. Using William Pitt Amherst’s entry as an example, these dates were 1773 and 1857, respectively (fig. 20).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-20\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-20.png\" id=\"fig20\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap20&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap20\">\n\nFig. 20.

Like birth and death date, other <em>Dictionary</em> entry details followed a consistent logic that could be structured into rules the computer could follow. For example, one of the features I knew we could retrieve systematically was that of certain family relationships. The <em>Dictionary</em> used often “o. s. of,” an abbreviation meaning “oldest son of,” that was followed always by the parent names (fig. 21).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-21\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-21.png\" id=\"fig21\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap21&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap21\">\n\nFig. 21.

The computer learned to do the same for “dau,” and “s,” whether or not it was followed by “surv,” “yr,” or “yst” (abbreviations for “daughter,” “son,” “surviving,” “younger,” and “youngest,” respectively) and thus added all this parent data into the database.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is that of marriage dates and spouse names, which were possible to capture by teaching the computer to search for the abbreviation “m.,” used in the <em>Dictionary</em> to indicate marriage, as well as to check to see if there was a one-digit number following “m.,” which indicated a case of multiple marriages (fig. 22a). The computer then captured the four-digit number indicating the marriage year (fig. 22b) and the words following the date, naming the spouse (fig. 22c).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-22\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-22.png\" id=\"fig22\" onload=\"resize(this, getElementById(&apos;22b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig22c&apos;))\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;22b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig22c&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap22&apos;), true)\" /> </a> <a name=\"figure-21b\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-21b.png\" id=\"22b\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig22&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;fig22c&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap22&apos;), true)\" /> </a> <a name=\"figure-22c\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-22c.png\" id=\"fig22c\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig22&apos;), getElementById(&apos;22b&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap22&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap22\">\n\nFig. 22.

Still looking at William Pitt Amherst, we see that searching for one of the abbreviations used for Oxbridge colleges (“Ch. Ch. Oxf.” is “Christ Church College, Oxford”) would yield information about this traveler’s education (fig. 23a), while searching for “gov.-gen” (governor-general) would give information about his occupation (fig. 23b).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-23\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-23.png\" id=\"fig23\" onload=\"resize(this, getElementById(&apos;fig23b&apos;))\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig23b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap23&apos;))\" /> </a> <a name=\"figure-23b\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-23b.png\" id=\"fig23b\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig23&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap23&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap23\">\n\nFig. 23.

But for the travel section, there is no such guide; identifying regularities to discern any organizational grammar from which to craft an algorithm had to be done from scratch. This section, on the surface, appears to be structured more intuitively than others—after all, the travels list contains a series of dates and places—yet it required more interpretative work, such as figuring out how to identify multiple tours, recognize cases of nesting, and deal with numerous uncertainties and inconsistencies. Here are a few examples of how this worked.</p>\n\n<p>The first step, again, was to isolate the travels section from the rest of the entry (fig. 24).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-24\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-24.png\" id=\"fig24\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap24&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap24\">\n\nFig. 24. The highly structured information about travels from a sample entry.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The next step was to teach the computer to identify the tours by searching for lines starting with a four-digit number, which indicated the year of the tour. For Bertie Abingdon, the parsing found and filled in the data for two tours, one in the years 1763 to 1765 and a second in the year 1770 (fig. 25).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-25\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-25.png\" id=\"fig25\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap25&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap25\">\n\nFig. 25. Parsing for tours: an example, from a sample entry, of what our algorithm taught the computer to look for&mdash;lines starting with a four-digit number in the travels section&mdash;in order to identify records of the year in which travelers started a tour and whether they took more than one tour. All information was then retrieved as data for our database.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Then the algorithm instructed the computer to isolate any information separated by punctuation that delineated different units of time and locations (which I eventually chose to call “visits”). The information in square brackets had to be treated differently from that in the Italian tours, as it became clear that square brackets were used in the <em>Dictionary</em> to mark destinations outside of Italy (fig. 26).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-26\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-26.png\" id=\"fig26\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap26&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap26\">\n\nFig. 26.

We also designed the algorithm to recognize information appearing within square brackets as marking destinations outside of Italy.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>One of the harder things to figure out was how to teach the computer to distinguish locations from dates clearly while still creating a structure that maintained the intersection of time and space that makes travel what it is: movement through space in time. This required first teaching the computer to separate location and time information, placing in one column the recorded sites of travel and in a different one the relevant dates. By this logic, the next step was to create an algorithm to supplement missing temporal information, deriving the missing dates from the known information preceding or following it so that each location could be associated with a corresponding time frame. In the case below, for example, given that we know the traveler was in Geneva by September 1763, for the previous location, where the entry only notes “Naples, March,” the algorithm taught the computer to deduce that this must be March 1763 and not 1764 (fig. 27).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-27\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-27.png\" id=\"fig27\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap27&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap27\">\n\nFig. 27.

The data that this processing retrieved constitutes the project’s MongoDB database (a robust NoSQL technology that stores information as JSON-like documents). We selected MongoDB because of its ease in handling changes and adaptation as countless iterative runs were implemented for additional parsing or refining existing results. From the start, the data was easily transferred from MongoDB to Google Sheets, which is where we assessed repeatedly (at every run) any need for changes, refinement, adjustments, error correction, or missing parts.</p>\n\n<p>Google Sheets allowed us to set the entries with their unique IDs as main tabs, with the different text components (biography, travel, narrative, footnotes) placed into different columns. It also facilitated the inclusion of other tabs for additional dimensions such as education or marriages. For example, figure 30 shows an early version of the education tab, which includes columns for place of education, degree, start and end date, and “individual studied under” (a category introduced to accommodate artists who were listed as apprenticing with other artists). Cells are filled or left blank according to available information in the entries (for no individual do we have every data point filled). To be clear, the goal here was not some unattainable notion of completeness but a process characterized by integrity and systematic accountability.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-30\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-30.png\" id=\"fig30\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap30&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap30\">\n\nFig. 30.

That first step in the process of “chunking” the text file of the print <em>Dictionary</em> to identify the entries itself went through a transformation as we sought to bring the world of the Grand Tour to life with all the travelers that animated the pages of the <em>Dictionary</em>, not just those present explicitly in the entries’ headings.</p>\n\n<p>After we had practiced many rounds of the new parsing approach systematically and iteratively over a few months, we took stock. Our focus had been chunking entries and retrieving data from the entries’ first two sections (the biographical and travel information). In our documentation, we reported proudly that we had identified and analyzed “5,300 entries, 5,284 tours, 14,964 single visits, and 285 unique places.” There was a sense of exhilaration and relief in our ability to provide these numbers. Up to that point, we had been unable to state how many travelers’ entries populated the pages of the <em>Dictionary</em>: our manual collection of travelers’ data had encountered and resolved many idiosyncrasies, but we had not worked through these systematically—instead resolving each on an ad-hoc basis; nor had we consistently documented the process. The only full measure of the scope of the <em>Dictionary</em> we could rely on was the publisher’s original release note stating that “this remarkable Dictionary identifies more than 6,000 British and Irish travelers who toured in Italy in the eighteenth century.” When we had a computational count of 5,300 entries identified by parsing, we assumed initially that the editors had overcounted.</p>\n\n<p>What we had yet to parse were our own assumptions. We had presumed a one-to-one correspondence between entries and travelers in the <em>Dictionary</em>. But the particularities of the <em>Dictionary</em>—both in terms of the connections between many of its people and the vagaries in the historical records documenting them—made for, in many instances, a far more complex relation between entries and travelers. We started noting the variety of exceptions, from headings that only referred to other entries, to entries that held multiple travelers under a single heading. From the beginning of our digital transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em>, we had envisioned creating an entry for each traveler. That seemed all the more necessary as we embarked on the digital parsing with its promise of precision. Upholding this principle, though, required treating all exceptions systematically. During this process, we ended up adjusting—alternatively eliminating and adding entries—our initially parsed fifty-three hundred entries. We also came up against limits when we couldn’t be sure of the exact number of travelers in the <em>Dictionary</em>’s records, but we did end up with a precise notion of the amount of uncertainty contained in our own data. Ultimately, we ended up with a database containing 6,007 travelers’ entries, which is almost exactly what the <em>Dictionary</em>’s publisher had stated in its release note.</p>\n\n<p>The first set of modifications to our count resulted from mechanical parsing errors. There were a few cases in which—possibly owing to the quality of the OCR text we had for the full text of the <em>Dictionary</em>—the parsing mashed together two entries, absorbing the entry of a second traveler within the main text of the previous one. The first such case we noted was the very brief entry for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1010\">Harriet Cobley</a> (travel year 1784). The one-liner “1784 Leghorn (betw. Jan and Mar.; Assheton list MSS)” had absorbed a more extensive entry—for the Irish merchant Cobley in Naples—which appeared after it in the printed pages of the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> Given that these two print entries were mashed under a single heading, the initial digital parsing created them as a single entry with the Entry ID of 1010. We manually created a separate new entry for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1010.1\">Cobley</a> the merchant (travel years 1778–80) and gave it the Entry ID of 1010.1. There are another two cases of this sort, and we found them only through manual checking.</p>\n\n<p>The other cases in which we had to delete from or add to the initial fifty-three hundred entries occurred because of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s somewhat quirky way of dealing with historical records of past people—how those records were transformed and adapted in the <em>Dictionary</em> initially, and then how they were eventually recorded in our database. The discrepancies also concern issues about class and gender and how these intersect with the preservation of historical information.</p>\n\n<p>The first instance of wrinkles in the noncorrelation between individual entries and individual travelers led to the number of entries actually decreasing further from the initial fifty-three hundred. On the very first page of the <em>Dictionary</em>, readers will notice that some entries refer to other entries. For example, on the first page, the entry for John Abbot, merchant, reads “see Francis Harriman,” sending the reader to page 467, where one sees that all that is documented about Abbot in Italy is contained in the entry of his fellow merchant, Harriman. This type of reference in the Explorer is resolved with the “mentioned names” feature: <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2266\">Harriman</a> appears as a “mentioned name” for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3\">Abbot</a>, so clicking on his name sends users quickly from his entry to reading about Abbot’s time in Italy. But many “see” references are of a different sort. Readers searching for the 8th Earl of Abercorn who follow up on the indication to “see Lord James Paisley” on page 732, for example, will realize that “8th Earl of Abercorn” is not a different traveler but merely a case of “cross-reference to senior titles” made throughout the <em>Dictionary</em>. As Ingamells explains in his “Note on Method,” offspring of titled families “are generally listed under the name by which they travelled,” before they succeeded their fathers.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> In this case, James Hamilton traveled in Italy in 1739 as Lord Paisley (recorded in Florence archives as “Lord Pesely” and in Leghorn/Livorno archives as “Lord Phisely”), but he became the 8th of Earl of Abercorn when he succeeded his father, the 7th Earl of Abercorn, in 1744. While it was easy to isolate <em>all</em> cases of cross-references indicated by “see,” only through manual checking could we identify cross-references that indicated an alternate name for the same traveler. We found three hundred. Of these, the majority are alternate names in the context of family succession, but a few differ. Eleven pertain to women: in these cases, the name change refers to marriage, and this applies for both titled and nontitled women. For example, Hannah Countess Cowper is given as an alternate name for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2021\">Hannah Gore</a> (1758-1826, travel years 1774-1826); Emma Hart after marriage became <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2205\">Emma Hamilton</a> (1765-1815, travel years 1786-1800); and Margaret Murray after marriage became <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3499\">Marchesa Accaromboni</a> (1746-1784, travel years 1768-1784). One instance of a cross-referenced alternate name is actually used in the <em>Dictionary</em> to indicate an uncertainty: this is for “Britton,” who is also reported as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/567\">Bretton</a>. We took all these into account, eliminating them from the entries list while adding them to the names list as alternate names; thus, we saw our list of individual traveler entries actually shrink from fifty-three hundred to five thousand.</p>\n\n<p>In pursuit of a database in which every entry would correspond to a single traveler, we also faced the opposite: cases of “multiple-travelers headings.” For example, on the <em>Dictionary</em>’s page 76, the entry’s heading read simply “Belscher, Mr and Mrs,” followed by a one-line text: “1785–6 <em>Rome</em> (winter 1785–6; <em>Quinn jnl. MSS</em>).” Clearly, this referenced a married couple. We created two entries out of the original. In the Explorer database there is now one entry under the heading of “Mr Belscher” and another under “Mrs Belscher.” Beneath each, we placed the same text—the one-liner from the original entry—and attributed to both Belschers the same travel data. In terms of ID number, we eliminated the original entry ID 354 created by the parsing, replacing it with 354.1 for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/354.1\">Mr Belscher</a> and 354.2 for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/354.2\">Mrs Belscher</a> (both travel years 1785–86).</p>\n\n<p>Looking systematically back through our initially parsed database entries, we found 106 in total for which the headings included more than one traveler. The great majority of them are cases of married couples (nearly 80 percent) but there are also other relationship types—predominantly, but not exclusively, family relations. There are parents and children, as well as siblings, and there are business partners (who are often also family relations). Most cases of “multiple-travelers headings” entailed two travelers under a single heading, but some instances of three and even four individuals subsumed under one entry did occur—such as the three Beaghan sisters (possibly one of the longest headings in the <em>Dictionary</em>: “Beaghan, the Misses, three daus, of Edmund Beaghan of Sissinghurst, Kent”). For each of these, we split the entries into multiples in order to maintain the correspondence of one entry to one individual. Separating these groups of travelers into their own entries was exciting, especially as it highlighted a number of previously invisible people, in particular women. But it also presented us with challenges due to the scant information available.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hidden-figures-recovering-subsumed-travelers\">Hidden Figures: Recovering Subsumed Travelers</h2>\n\n<p>The final, newly created type of traveler entry that emerged in the process of making the Grand Tour Explorer database is also the most consequential and most frequently occurring, consisting of 890 entries and bringing the total entry count to 6,007. These are the entries we created for travelers for whom there were not headings in the original <em>Dictionary</em>. We came to call these travelers “hidden figures” because, having no original entry of their own, but rather appearing in someone else’s entry, they were subsumed under that person’s heading. It was a new use of technology that enabled us to identify these figures systematically. For the original parsing, chunking, and data extractions of the entries, we had used mostly Regular Expressions. But this approach would not help to identify people buried in the free text of the narratives, which did not have the same structured or semistructured organization of information as the biographical and travel paragraphs. Natural language processing proved to be the solution, and thanks to a student interning on the project, who was also in Dan Jurafkis’s classes at Stanford, we benefited from direct advice on how to proceed making use of the CoreNL tool kit developed by the Stanford Natural Language Group (<a href=\"https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/\">https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/</a>). The processing ran through the entirety of the print entries looking for entities that could be people, automatically creating lists of terms organized by relative entries. The lists had to be checked repeatedly in this reiterative process to refine the program. Our manual adjustments addressed simple confusions, resolved errors (for example, that Monviso is a mountain and not a person), and clarified ambiguities (for example, sometimes the same person might appear under different names).</p>\n\n<p>It was from these lists that we systematically identified the 890 hidden figures, the large majority of whom (around two-thirds) are women. We created entries for these travelers by adding a decimal point to the ID of the entry from which they originated. In the final design of the Explorer, we left the narrative empty as both a visual reminder of how these travelers had not been featured in the headings and also in consideration of the manipulations that would have been required to extract and adapt relevant parts from the original entries. We did include, however, any information we were able to gather by examining both biographical and travel data related to them in the original entries. This was painstaking manual work, but it seemed the right decision to fully restore these travelers’ presence in the database. The amount of data we could find varied greatly; equally varied was the type of traveler we recovered through this process. For example, this was the only manner of encountering those people who were termed at the time “servants” in any systematic way and being able to see them as an aggregate. In fact, we created a new occupational category of “domestic service” to make them discoverable in the Explorer.</p>\n\n<p>As stated above, roughly two-thirds of these hidden figures are women, and the largest subset within these are women whose travels had been subsumed in the <em>Dictionary</em> under their husbands’ entries. There are 326 such cases, and for each one we created a new entry. Some look similar to the women’s entries we created when splitting the headings of the “Mr and Mrs X” variety; indeed, there are ninety-five cases of “Mrs X” where we have only the husband’s last name. For many more, though, we also have a first name and for some, even a maiden name. This is most often the case because of rich biographical data contained in the husband’s entry, which might well record marriage date(s) and spouse name(s). Even if the narrative portion of the husband’s entry makes only cursory reference to the woman traveling as “wife,” we were able to extract her name by way of the husband’s biographical section. The richness of this type of biographical data points to the fact that many of these travelers were elite. Several were titled, and some were Grand Tourists who took multiple trips to Italy, first as young unmarried men and later with their spouses. In a few cases, British travelers married Italian women. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4903.1\">Giulia Bellotti</a> (travel years 1740–47) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5266.1\">Anna Gazzini</a> (travel years 1734–51), for example, originated blended families with lives unfolding between the two countries; we created entries for these Italo-British wives, too, to make them fully present in the world of the Grand Tour.</p>\n\n<p>Among the hidden figures there also exist—though, admittedly, more rarely—husbands whose travels were subsumed in the wife’s entry. We identified fifteen such cases where we created entries for hidden husbands. For six of these, the case is that of a British or Irish woman who married a foreign man: <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/754\">Mrs Cagnoni</a> (travel year 1727) married the Italian banker and agent <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/754.1\">Joseph Cagnoni</a> (travel years 1717–20); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2030\">Sarah Goudar</a> (travel years unknown), an Irish barmaid and author, married a <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2030.1\">Frenchman</a>; and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3204\">Mrs Conrad Martens</a> (travel years 1764–72) was an Englishwoman married to the <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3204.1\">Dutch consul</a> in Venice. Others married into Italian nobility. For the remaining nine cases, the wife became the entry’s namesake either because of her charisma or simply because she lived longer. Lady Hutton was in Italy with her husband, but he is never mentioned beyond their first visit in Florence and is reported dead in Bath when in fact she was still in Italy. In the case of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1544\">Lady Earle</a> (1739–1827, travel years 1770–71), she seems to simply carry the day: she traveled with her husband at all times, but most references are strictly about her. Charisma and marrying foreign combined in the instance of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3880\">Hester Thrale Piozzi</a> (1741–1821, travel years 1784–86): she traveled to Italy with her second husband, the Italian singer and composer <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3880.1\">Gabriel Mario Piozzi</a> (travel years 1784–86), but he remained almost invisible in all others’ records, as well as in her own printed account (which became one of the most influential travel writings of the century).</p>\n\n<p>Spouses—predominantly wives—are the most prevalent among the hidden figures, as well as the ones most easily accommodated within the data structure we put in place, given that marriages were among the data we had been capturing from the print entries of the <em>Dictionary</em>. A similarly easy fit was the case of children since our data already recorded parents. We found 192 daughters (165 drawn from their father’s entry and 27 from their mother’s) and 151 sons (126 drawn from their father’s entry and 25 from their mother’s). A hidden figure served also as our first encounter with a case of “data not available” for gender when we found reference to a “child” and not a “daughter” or “son”—for example, “the two children” stated to be living with their parents Terence and Maria O’Brien in Rome 1738–48 (see entries <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22index%22:%7B%22startIndex%22:%223627%22,%22endIndex%22:%223627.3%22%7D%7D\">3627 and 3627.3</a>). More indirectly still, we could accommodate mothers or fathers discovered in their children’s entries, of which we found fourteen (an example is the artist Henry Thomson, of whom it is stated that he was “in Italy with his father.”) We also found hidden figures in siblings’ entries. We identified twenty sisters (twelve found in a brother’s entry and eight in a sister’s) and thirteen brothers (twelve found in a brother’s entry and one in a sister’s). For these siblings, the relationship becomes apparent in the data when parents are recorded for all siblings or, at times, by reading entries very carefully. More distant family relationships revealed by hidden figures—among whom we count seven granddaughters, two grandsons, four sisters-in-law, three brothers-in-law, four nephews, and four vaguely termed “relations”—are sparse and not recorded in the data structure. What remains interesting is the prevalence of women even among the nonspousal hidden figures—a fact that is all the more intriguing when one considers these proportions against the full data set of travelers. Whether this is the result of vagaries of preservation or of traveling trends—such as the fact that women traveling were more likely to bring along their daughters while young men were more likely to travel alone—would require more systematic investigation. Still, the question is articulated by the data itself, emphasizing the significance of maintaining gender attribution in our categorization to enable the exploring of such issues.</p>\n\n<p>While by far the great majority of hidden figures are family relations of the travelers from whose entries they were drawn, we found other interesting cases. There are traveling companions (four women and seven men). There are also domestic servants, governesses, maids, and servants, for a total count of twenty-nine. Most of these remain unnamed in the database and would have stayed completely invisible if not recovered by parsing. There were, of course, many more whom we have not recovered. Most of the travelers would have been accompanied by servants or maids who remain unrecorded. The Venetian archives are a good reminder of their presence, with the records in most cases including the number of domestic workers accompanying travelers (as in fig. 31).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-31\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-31.jpg\" id=\"fig31\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap31&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap31\">\n\nFig. 31.

For some of the hidden figures, we don’t even know their names, as in the case of most domestic workers recorded only as “servants,” and many children. Still, bringing these people into visibility with their own entries in the database, we shine light on the scale and texture of the world of the Grand Tour while also accounting for the more than six thousand travelers known already to the <em>Dictionary</em>’s editors.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"unidentified-travelers-entries\">Unidentified Travelers’ Entries</h2>\n\n<p>One last type of entry requires explanation: those that in the print <em>Dictionary</em> pertain to more than one traveler but for which there is no discernible relation besides the sharing of a common name. The <em>Dictionary</em> contains multiple “one-liners”—entries with only a last name and one record of a visit—most often the effect of reproducing in the entry the record of travel from an archival document or the passing mention of a traveler in a contemporary source (see fig. 32).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-32\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-32.png\" id=\"fig32\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap32&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap32\">\n\nFig. 32. An example from the Explorer (Entry ID 677) of a one-liner entry for a traveler for whom the only record that remains is a surname and a mention of arrival in Venice on May 28, 1778.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>But sometimes a single <em>Dictionary</em> entry, headed only by a surname, includes records of multiple trips that appear to refer to different people who just happen to share the same surname. Figure 33 illustrates an entry that pertains to multiple travelers for whom we have only “<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/127\">Arthur</a>” as a name: the “Jacobite [. . . who] died in Rome in 1716” cannot be the same person who traveled in 1733 or 1795:</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-33\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-33.png\" id=\"fig33\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap33&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap33\">\n\nFig. 33. An example of an entry from the Explorer (Entry ID 127), grouping under the same heading a number of travelers that, given the range of dates of travel, could not possibly be the same person, but for whom the travel records, along with their surnames (which happen to be the same), are all that survive.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Distinguishing these travelers requires knowledge we do not currently possess and that may be irretrievable. The <em>Dictionary</em> preserved these archival traces to make them available in case future readers and researchers might build further connections and identifications. In keeping with the <em>Dictionary</em>’s goal of maintaining these fragmented records for future identification, we preserved these as digital traces, despite their deviating from the one-to-one equivalence between entries and travelers.</p>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">* * *</h2>\n\n<p>The refinement of the parsing process used to finalize the count of the entries was foundational and represents the most consequential act of data formalization: deciding what constitutes an entry in the Explorer means deciding who gets counted. The decision to create additional entries for hundreds of women, various children, and other forgotten figures transforms the <em>Dictionary</em> and makes a world of travel inclusive of many more, and more diverse, people. This was active decision-making and an act of interpretation: joining quantitative historiography to qualitative historiography.</p>\n\n<p>Gender is the one attribute, in addition to Entry ID, that pertains to all entries. Current debates in data practices have called attention to the prescriptive nature of this categorization’s fundamentally binary character, and I hesitated to reproduce the binary of “male” and “female,” with the third option of “unknown” when unable to assign one of the two.<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup> Research on gender in relation to the Grand Tour, moreover, has shown how fraught the category was regarding travels to Italy specifically.<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> Italy was perceived and constructed as a land of castrati, cicisbei, emasculated Italian men, and oversexualized women, all of which was said to pose the risk of “feminization” for British tourists. I determined finally to follow this binary system because this was the basic categorization used at the time, and it was important to us to bring to the fore the women who were otherwise suppressed in most records. Not assigning gender would have kept these travelers invisible. By using the terms <em>female traveler</em>, <em>male traveler</em>, and <em>data not available</em>, I hope we make it clear that this is a decision relative to this project, one that reflects the use of “man” and “woman” in the eighteenth-century world of our study. One of the advantages of the dynamic structure of this digital database is that future researchers downloading it might well change this column to adapt it to different interests or additional knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Gender is only an implicit category in the print <em>Dictionary</em>. As we started making gender a data point, we considered various degrees of assumption-making about the travelers’ gender identities. At first, we assigned gender only by following more explicit signaling, for example instructing the parsing to identify and capture designations such as “daughter” or “son” to determine how we would qualify a traveler’s gender. Using this process, we had information for 1,776 men and 206 women. Next, we began using first names and titles to attribute gender, and when these were absent, we started checking whether “she” or “he” pronouns were used in the narrative. In the absence of all such indications, we categorized the entries as gender “data not available.” It is essential to remember that there is nothing in any of this data indicating if and how a traveler may have conceived of their gender differently than what these social categories imposed on them.</p>\n\n<p>Figure 34 illustrates the full scope of our final total of entries giving a basic sense of the foundational characteristics of the database and the total count of all entries. Visualized here are the gender and origin dimensions. The entries which we created from existing ones in the print <em>Dictionary</em> appear as dark purple dots, and those we newly created for the hidden figures appear as dots in light grey. The grouping by gender shows how much more purple there is among the entries of female or data-not-available gender type. This is the world of travelers who, as a result of the transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em>, populate the Grand Tour Explorer.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-34\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-5/figure-34.png\" id=\"fig34\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap34&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap34\">\n\nFig. 34.

        "content"  : "<p>The Welsh painter Thomas Jones (1742–1803, travel years 1776–83), spent the last three years of his Italian sojourn in the city of Naples, from 1780 to 1783, and he left vivid accounts in words and images of his urban experience. His sensitivity to color and light and his attention to detail in his daily life are represented in a range of sources of unusual and extraordinary quality which have been used to reconstruct the lives and networks of British Grand Tour artists in Italy. This qualitative detail from Jones’s sources is in contrast to the quantitative weight of the information provided by the Grand Tour Explorer, which is primarily focused on British and Irish travelers. Yet, using word searches and making connections, the Grand Tour Explorer can bring us closer to travelers’ sensory experiences of urban life, which appear so vividly in Jones’s memoirs and paintings, as well as reveal interactions between Grand Tourists and Italians. The quantitative dimension afforded by the transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em> allows a more qualitative understanding of the travelers’ experience; for example, the length of time spent in a city might indicate the depth of engagement with the city by a Grand Tourist. In this essay, further analysis of the Explorer also shows the variety of the kinds of British travelers and residents living and dying in eighteenth-century Italy and the extent to which Italians have been obscured by the historiography on the Grand Tour. The life of Thomas Jones, therefore, provides an illuminating point of entry from which to explore the interlinked nature of Anglo-Italian cultural relations created by the Grand Tour.</p>\n\n<p>Two portraits frame the life of Jones. The first portrait, by his friend Giuseppe (or Joseph) Liberati Marchi (1735?–1808), was painted in 1768, when Jones and the artist were visiting Wales from London (fig. 1).<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> The preeminent British portraitist of the late eighteenth century, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4067\">Joshua Reynolds</a> (1723–92, travel years 1750–52), had met the teenage Marchi while touring Italy and brought him back to Britain, where he worked as Reynolds’s assistant for more than forty years. The second portrait of Jones and his family (fig. 2), by Francesco Renaldi (1755–c. 1798), also painted in Wales, was done in 1797, by which time Jones had spent seven years in Italy and had returned home to run his family’s estate. Renaldi was a British painter of Italian parentage who had trained and exhibited in London. He had also stayed with Jones in Naples for three months in 1781 and would later spend ten years working as a painter in Bengal, before returning to Britain and painting this and other portraits of the Jones family.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Jones, Marchi, and Renaldi were friends and part of a network of painters with connections to the British Grand Tour in Italy. While Marchi (and even Renaldi, who was born in Britain) escaped the focused attention of the compiler of <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy, 1701–1800</em> (compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells, 1997), Reynolds’s and Jones’s entries provide at least some mention of these two Anglo-Italian artists from which one can build a sharper picture of the interconnectedness and movement within the Explorer. These portraits of Thomas Jones frame a life that began and ended in Wales, but they hide the hybrid origins and cultural identities of this trio of painters, as well as the nature and depth of their lived experiences in Italy and beyond.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../calaresu-figure-1.png\" id=\"fig1\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1\">\n\nFig. 1.

Jones balances a palette, paintbrush, and painter’s <em>mahlstick</em> on one arm; there is a folder of prints in front of him and an unfinished landscape on an easel behind him. He looks away from his wife and daughters, who are portrayed as models of provincial propriety and accomplishment (Renaldi, or perhaps one of his brothers, peers over the scene from the center of the canvas.)<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> Jones never returned to Italy; by the time of this portrait, his professional career as a painter was finished, and he would devote the final years of his life to running his family’s estate, writing in 1798 that his life had become “with little interruptions, one uniform scene of domestick Retirement—at times, indeed, amusing myself with my beloved Art,” painting for his own amusement.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-2\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../calaresu-figure-2.png\" id=\"fig2\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap2&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap2\">\n\nFig. 2.

His Neapolitan life can be found in the many sources that he left behind—his paintings of the city, his “Memoirs” cited above (based on a diary that he kept at the time at his side, now lost) and a full set of household accounts.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> None of this material is new and yet, while art historians have used the “Memoirs” and accounts in their analysis of his paintings, few have analyzed these sources, either written or painted, together, as careful and evocative observations of urban life. Jones’s visual representations of Naples as a city, especially its buildings and urban spaces, are unique for this period and also for what looks like their abstraction and the absence of any people. Jones’s paintings of the city’s rooftops and spaces conform neither to the contemporary taste for ethnographic representations of Neapolitan street culture, made popular by painters such as Pietro Fabris, nor for the panoramic views of the city by his friend Giovanni Battista Lusieri.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> All of Jones’s Neapolitan cityscapes were painted on paper, suggesting that, like his diary entries, they were his private visual musings and not meant for sale or display to Grand Tourists.</p>\n\n<p>These textual and visual sources evoke urban experience on the Grand Tour—the sounds of streets, the surfaces of buildings, the light hitting canvas awnings. This attention to (sensory) detail in relation to the urban experience of visitors to Italian cities is not easily replicated in the entries of the <em>Dictionary</em> or in their digital transformation in the Grand Tour Explorer. Using the “free-search” function in the Explorer for words relating to the sensory and spatial experience of urban life—such as <em>smoke</em>, <em>noise</em>, <em>crowd</em>, <em>carriage</em>, <em>cart</em>, <em>stall</em>, or <em>porter</em>—leads to just a few faint traces. For example, bells appear in an anecdote about <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/587\">Frederick Augustus Hervey</a>, 4th Earl of Bristol’s (1730–1803, travel years 1765–66, 1770–72, 1777–79, 1785–86, 1789–90, 1794–1803) aversion to them as a religious procession passed by his hotel in Siena, which the <em>Dictionary</em>, and hence the Explorer, record from an early nineteenth-century memoir.<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup> While Jones’s account of the “Chaos of Noises Filth and Confusion” around his first apartment in Naples is cited from the “Memoirs,” in the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entry and the Explorer, the reasons for the chaos or his concern about putting off prospective clients are not.<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Using Jones’s tour and, in particular, his residence in Naples, as a starting point, this essay seeks to illuminate cases in which the British experience of Italian cities was sustained and engaged, when tourists engaged more deeply with their Italian counterparts and when their stays stretched longer—for some, in fact, becoming lifelong. Close consideration of Jones’s paintings and accounts provides clues to guide a “distant reading” through the Explorer. Could the digital transformation operated by the Explorer allow us to glean more of the Italian presence from the <em>Dictionary</em>’s pages? Seeking to grasp the elusive sensory experience of eighteenth-century travelers, could the interpersonal and the temporal dimensions of travel that the Explorer offers help us better color our vision of the British Grand Tour?</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"representing-naples-in-the-paintings-and-words-of-thomas-jones\">Representing Naples in the Paintings and Words of Thomas Jones</h1>\n\n<p>On his visit to Naples, the German painter Jacob Philipp Hackert complimented Jones, recognizing their affinity as painters who paid “due attention to the <em>Detail</em>—that is to say, minute finishing.”<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup> This exactness of detail led to the rediscovery of Jones’s work in the mid-twentieth century; this same exactness comes through in his “Memoirs,” as he evokes the sounds and smells of the streets of Italian cities in words. His eye and ear for these details are apparent from the beginning of his tour in Italy, as he passes through different cities, making observations along the way, perhaps distinguishing himself from other Grand Tourists who pay no heed to what happens outside their carriages. For instance, a walk early in the morning brings an observation about the different ways that porters carry their goods in Turin and Milan. Jones then continues: “It being cold foggy weather, all the men were muffled up to their noses in cloaks, or loose great Coats, with the Sleeves hanging down according to the Italian custom, and Smoking out of curved wooden pipes, the bowls of which only appeared.”<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> This level of evocative detail extends to descriptions of other environments in which the senses dominate. In Rome, his breath “stop’d” as he entered a room full of smoking Scandinavians and Slavs in Rome,<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> and, in the heat of late September, he recalls, “I was kept in a gentle perspiration, sitting in my Shirt &amp; thin linnen Drawers without Stockens—with the Windows open—and in this dress I sat down to paint.”<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup> He recounts a night at the opera in Naples with <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3908\">Giuseppe Plura</a> (b. 1753, travel years 1778–81), which he had to abandon “as the noise was so great that we could not hear the Performers, and the dazzling Glare of the Candles &amp; looking-glasses made me quite giddy.”<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> His descriptions are not so much an indication of his eye and ear for ethnographic detail but of his sensitivity to the senses—of sight, sound, and smell.</p>\n\n<p>His paintings of the city are the visual equivalent of these sensory descriptions—the light hitting the pitted surface of walls, the dark cavities of building interiors. These descriptions and paintings establish Jones as an evocative witness to urban life.</p>\n\n<p>In his “Memoirs,” Jones also gives us clues to his immersion in Italian culture. Like many Grand Tourists, he literally carried ideas about Italians in his jacket pocket as he traveled, but these guidebooks were soon put to the test by his actual interactions with people. Not long after arriving in Rome, he seemed genuinely surprised not to be knifed after a night of conversation with “three sprightly girls,” the daughters of an innkeeper near Frascati:</p>\n\n<p>We were joined by a Couple of young Fellows muffled up to the nose in their long cloaks—I had been so prepossessed, by books, with frightful ideas of Italian jealousy and Italian revenge, that I sat in Agony for the Consequence, nor could my Companions reasoning or ridicule entirely divert me of it—However we at length cheerfully sat down to supper—and soon after went to bed and slept soundly, devoid of Care.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>By 1779, Jones knew Italian well enough to write love letters for his friend <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3749\">William Pars</a> (1742–82, travel years 1775–82), with pleasing results; “the favourable reception and the kind answers” that Pars received to these “Amorous Epistles” was testimony to Jones’s skill in written Italian.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup> From Naples in 1782, Jones remarked that he had not seen an English newspaper since leaving Rome two years earlier.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> His immersion is also evidenced in the account book in which he recorded his expenses in Naples, shifting suddenly from English to Italian on the day after he slept in his apartment in front of the Dogana del Sale (depicted in fig. 3), just days after arriving in the city.<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../calaresu-figure-3.png\" id=\"fig3\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap3\">\n\nFig. 3.

National Museum of Wales, Cardiff (NMW A 89).\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The depth of Jones’s immersion in Naples distinguishes him from many British Grand Tourists. As he had promised himself after his first unsuccessful meeting with Hamilton in May 1780, he avoided the company of English tourists as much as he could and, instead, kept company with Italians, with whom he claims to have kept up a correspondence years after he left Italy (although none of it survives).<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> Within months of Renaldi’s arrival in Naples in July 1781, he had introduced Jones to the Italian painters Giuseppe Bonito and Luigi Micheli; in turn, Micheli lived on the same street as Giambattista Lusieri, who also became Jones’s friend.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup> Micheli and Lusieri appear respectively as Don Luigi and Don Titta in Jones’s “Memoirs.” (Lusieri also appears in four other entries in the Explorer by this nickname, transcribed variously as Don Titta, Don Teta, and Don Tito.)<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> Jones’s relationship with these Italian artists is part of a larger web of interconnections that extends well beyond the bounds of the Explorer to include, for instance, overlapping circles of friendship and acquaintance with French artists in Naples such as Pierre-Jacques Volaire.<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> These are relationships of varying intensities with non-British artists whose works surfaced in British country-house collections—relationships that begin to come into view also through the Explorer as visualized in figure 4.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../calaresu-figure-4.png\" id=\"fig4\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap4&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\nFig. 4. Thomas Jones in relation to the mentioned names in his entry text, as parsed by the Explorer. Names in italics indicate people who do not have their own entries and suggest a much wider network of non-British relationships. The figure also distinguishes in maroon the relationships that originated or flourished in Naples, indicating the depth of Jones&rsquo;s involvement in this city&rsquo;s social life.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>This brief analysis of Jones’s paintings and “Memoirs” shows the extent to which both are witness to his Neapolitan life. Jones lived in three residences across the city—the first near the Dogana di Sale, which kept him close to the clamor of the warehouses and port; the second near Capodimonte, which kept him close to his new Italian artist friends Lusieri and Micheli; and the third, behind Chiaia, which brought him closer to the “court side” of town and represented a final attempt to find the Grand Tourist patrons that he so desired. His evocation of urban life in Naples illustrates how he could escape the rhetorical and visual tropes of British representations of Italy. When he was writing his “Memoirs,” which he finished fifteen years after his return to Britain in 1798, he reflected on his delight, early during his time in Italy, that he was so “familiarized with, &amp; enamoured of Italian forms,” having copied Italian landscapes under the tutelage of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3749\">Richard Wilson</a> in London in the 1760s (1713–82, travel years 1750–56/57).<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> But Jones’s cityscapes show his willingness to look elsewhere for inspiration. In this way, he was able to develop his own unique visual style, which recorded the light, space, and textures that surrounded him in the city of Naples.</p>\n\n<p>Jones’s life and work also reveal the value of British artists as historical informants and the ways in which we can find Italian and British experience of Italy in the extraordinary wealth of material that came out of the eighteenth-century Grand Tour. Can the Explorer allow researchers to develop and build more histories of these connections, engagements, and exchanges with Italy and Italians, while engaging with the qualitative analyses of the many (and often familiar) sources produced by the Grand Tour?</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"word-searching-for-italians\">(Word) Searching for Italians</h1>\n\n<p>Thomas Jones claimed that Romans divided British travelers into three classes: <em>Artisti</em> (“here, as well for Study and Improvement, as emolument by their profession”), <em>Mezzi-Cavalieri</em> (“who lived genteely, independent of any profession, and kept a servant”), and the true <em>Cavalieri</em> or <em>Milordi Inglesi</em> (“those who moved in a Circle of Superior Splendour”).<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> Jones himself was uncertain about his own place within these first two categories, and his life story justifies that ambivalence.<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup> What is not included in his characterization is a fourth crossover class of British residents who lived and worked in Italian cities—diplomats, merchants, and men who served the Grand Tour industry or those who might have come to Italy as artists or gentlemen but then set up a household in Italy, becoming longer-term residents. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2219\">William Hamilton</a>, the British emissary to Naples, is perhaps the best known of longer term residents, living in the city more or less continuously, with some brief breaks in England and other parts of Italy, between 1764 and 1800; his enduring presence and power in the city and at the Bourbon court makes him a particularly important node from which to study the British community in Naples, Grand Tourists in particular. There were also British merchants with long-standing relationships to the city for which further archival research in the Italian archives would be necessary to go beyond the Grand Tour Explorer (curiously, there is <em>another</em> <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2218\">William Hamilton</a> (travel years 1753–57), “the oldest and most Eminent Merchant” in the city of Naples, who appears twice in the records, once in 1753 and again in 1757).<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup> The British <em>ciceroni</em> who served the tourist industry were important intermediaries between the British community and Italians and, by necessity, had specific knowledge of Italian cities to offer to their clients, as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/paul-ciceroni-and-their-clients\">Carole Paul</a>’s essay on <em>ciceroni</em> demonstrates. These distinctions between Grand Tourists and longer-term residents necessarily reveal that cities could be lived in as more than simply places of amusement, education, or exploitation.</p>\n\n<p>Jones’s “Memoirs” indicate a variety of important relationships formed not just with other long-term British residents but also with Italians. During his professional travails, he wrote, desolately, “Looking upon my self as deserted by my Countrymen—the depression of my Spirits was such, that I endeavored avoiding as much as possible those places where I was most likely to meet them.”<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> As noted above, Jones was determined to make friends with some local Italian artists, friendships that endured beyond his return to Wales three years later. Yet these Italian men—and Italian women, as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/sama-rosalba-carriera\">Catherine Sama</a>’s essay on Rosalba Carriera shows—are largely absent from Grand Tour scholarship as a whole.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>As its title indicates, the <em>Dictionary</em> set out to include only entries relating to British and Irish travelers and did not include entries related to the constellation of Italians involved in the Grand Tour. There are, however, brief biographical notes at the back of the Grand Tour <em>Dictionary</em> dedicated to “select foreign artists, antiquaries, and diplomats . . . whose names recur in the <em>Dictionary</em>.” Two-thirds of these supplementary characters are identified as Italian (forty-one out of a total sixty-two); of these, the majority are artists long dead before the eighteenth century, which highlights the antiquarian and artistic interests of the Grand Tour as filtered through the hands of Brinsley Ford, Ingamells, and their collaborators.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> The <em>Dictionary</em> takes an idiosyncratic approach to a number of Anglo-Italians: it grants no entries, for example, to Marchi or Renaldi, who had painted Thomas Jones and his family before and after his time in Italy, nor do these two artists appear in the supplementary biographies at the back of the <em>Dictionary</em>. In contrast, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3908\">Giuseppe (or Joseph) Plura</a>, the son of a Turinese sculptor who had settled in Bath, and a traveling companion for Jones on his first trip to Naples, is included among the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entries.<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup> This difficulty of “fixing” as either British or Italian the hybrid nature of family lives and career trajectories that crossed Britain and Italy is clear, for example, in the case of the musical performers <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4569\">Anna Storace</a> (1766–1817, travel years 1778–84, c. 1787–c. 1801) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4570\">Stephen Storace</a> (1763–96, travel years c. 1775–81), both of whom were born and died in Britain but whose professional life was only recorded by Grand Tourists when they were in Italy.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Dictionary</em>’s pages are peppered with mentions of Italian names, and an advantage of the digital Explorer is that it allows us to find many of these Italians who did not merit individual recognition in the original print text. Using the “free-search” function, one can produce a number of matching entries for a more comprehensive review “by hand,” and the Explorer’s mentioned names permit a more systematic search for Italian presence as well. Jones provides a good example: the graph visualizing the names mentioned in his entry includes a third of individuals, mostly Italians and other foreigners, who do not have entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>, drawing on a wider field of names and connections to our study of Jones’s life in Italy (see fig. 4).</p>\n\n<p>Many Italians appearing in the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entries are artists, however, and their mention only relates to specific works of architecture or art that Grand Tourists had seen or were buying (works by Palladio, Guercino, and Batoni, for example). The <em>Dictionary</em> must have been an important starting point for Ilaria Bignamini and Clare Hornsby’s reconstruction of the antiquities market in eighteenth-century Rome, in which many Italians engaged daily with British agents such as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2207\">Gavin Hamilton</a> (1723–98, travel years 1748–50, 1756–98), <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2680\">Thomas Jenkins</a> (1722–98, travel years 1751–98), and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1652\">Robert Fagan</a> (1761–1816, travel years 1781–82, 1784–1814, c. 1815–16), but who remain to be studied in further detail.<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> Many other entries make mention of British painters and architects both known, such as Carlo Fontana, and unknown, such as “Signor Abramo Paris,” teacher of the Scottish architect <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1937\">James Gibb</a> (1682–1754, travel years 1703–8).</p>\n\n<p>In fact, if one searches for “Signor” in the entries, a number of Italians come up (along with some British travelers such as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2283\">Joanna Hart</a> [travel years 1756–57], who appears as “Signora Giovanna Harz” in the citation of a primary source).<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup> In many cases, these Italians are difficult or impossible to trace without further archival research. For example, “Signor Giacomo” was paid for some architectural plans and for teaching <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1032\">Thomas Coke</a> of Holkham (1697–1759, travel years 1713–17). Less well-known artists, copyists, and modelers who served the Grand Tour community also turn up in a search under <em>Signor</em>: for example, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1179\">George Craster</a> (1735–72, travel years 1761–62), an army officer from Craster, Northumbria, commissioned two portraits by Batoni and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1288\">Nathaniel Dance</a> (1735–1811, travel years 1754–66), but he also commissioned “copies in miniature by signora Tibaldi.”<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup> Agents such as those in Rome also met the collecting needs of British tourists in other Italian cities, such as Signor Magnolfi, the Florentine agent for the antiquary John Talman (1677–1726, travel years 1699–1702, 1709–17, 1719, 1721, 1723). More <em>signori</em> appear as part of the Grand Tour “service” community including guides and companions such as “Signor Armano of Bologna,” who accompanied <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2445\">Richard Colt Hoare</a> (1758–1838, travel years 1785–87, 1788–91), for the voyage from Tuscany to Rome or Signora Minerbetti, Horace Mann’s <em>cicisbea</em>, who presented <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1508.1\">Lady Mary Tufton</a> (1723–1806, travel years 1773–78)—the wife of the Scottish aristocrat <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1508\">William Duncan</a> (c. 1715–74, travel years 1773–74)—to the Grand Duke of Florence.<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Encounters with Italian <em>signori</em>, however, do not always imply some sort of transcultural understanding or exchange with British travelers. We know that guidebooks framed the responses of British travelers to Italian life, carrying with them characterizations of Italy inherited from anti-Catholic rhetoric developed since the Reformation (and compounded by ancient climatic theories revived by Montesquieu and others in the eighteenth century).<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup> We also know that the British traveling community often stuck together, socializing and traveling in groups and using the same service networks. As <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3319\">William Mildmay</a> (c. 1705–71, travel years 1730–31) suggests in his description on arriving in Leghorn/Livorno in 1730, many British travelers and residents lived in close-knit English-speaking communities; he writes that “there are computed to be about 43 English families at present &amp; our language is as frequently heard in the streets &amp; coffee houses, as the Italian itself.” These communities were well-served: <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3793\">Thomas Pelham</a> (1756–1826, travel years 1777, 1792–93), for instance, was thrilled to have found in Florence a Signor Molini, who “will sell me all kind of English things . . . from Birmingham”; and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2759\">David Ker</a> (1742–1811, travel years 1792–94), an Irishman, boasted that he had made “an Italian servant we had at Florence into a very good English Cook.” Food was a particular concern for Grand Tourists, many of them overcome by a longing for roast beef and disdain for French sauces as soon as they left the shores of England.<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup> Italian food seems to have fared better in diaries and travel accounts, although Grand Tourists were always looking for a good roast. After three months in Italy, Jones notes that he and his companion “were both heartily sick of the Italian Soups &amp; Stews . . . and were obliged to be our own cooks”; his friends were “very glad to sit down to a piece of Roast Beef and Plumb pudding.”<sup id=\"fnref:40\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></sup> Later, in his memoirs, however, we can see Jones adapting to a new culinary regime. In the final months of his stay in Italy, Jones recorded a visit to “a large Manufactory of Maccaroni” on the outskirts of Naples, near Torre Annunziata (where the manufacturing of <em>pastasciutta</em> continues today), and he bought twenty-four pounds of macaroni as part of his food supplies for his family’s trip home to England by sea in August 1783.<sup id=\"fnref:41\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></sup> While Grand Tourists often longed for English food while away from home, this taste for Italian food in England was not unusual; a number of them wanted to recreate these new tastes and flavors, shipping home Chianti wine and Parmesan cheese and, after their return, buying more Italian food from fashionable grocers in London.<sup id=\"fnref:42\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></sup> Jones’s reliance on such a large amount of macaroni as a foodstuff for his trip home to England confirms the depth of his and his family’s alimentary acculturation during his long residency in the city.<sup id=\"fnref:43\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Travel to Italy, at least dating from the Renaissance, was meant to be educational, and in the eighteenth century, the Grand Tour had not yet lost its didactic function. Travelers not only acquired wheels of Parmesan cheese and antique Roman objects to ship back to Britain, but many were also keen to gain some knowledge of the modern Italian language.<sup id=\"fnref:44\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></sup> Grammar books were produced specifically for this purpose,<sup id=\"fnref:45\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></sup> and a number of <em>signori</em> in the Explorer provided instruction in Italian. When the antiquarian <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4040\">Richard Rawlinson</a> (1690–1755, travel years 1720–26) returned to Rome in the autumn of 1721, he “learned that his language master had died but within four days he had found another, ‘Signore de la Mothe.’” In Rome, in the summer of 1777, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3793\">Thomas Pelham</a> spent his mornings “employed in learning Italian &amp; the History of Italy,” and when he was in Florence in the autumn, he hired his father’s former Italian-language teacher, the Abbé Pellori. There were, of course, Italians who could speak English and entertain and keep the British travelers company. Thomas Jones noted with pleasure that, after a day’s sightseeing during a short stay in Bologna, on his way down to Rome, he had “met Dr Geraldi, who spoke good English, at the Cof-House.”<sup id=\"fnref:46\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></sup> One British resident in Florence wrote that since <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5044\">William Weddell</a> (1736–92, travel years 1764–65) and his companion spoke no Italian or French and “the Society of the Inhabitants here did not give them much pleasure, they chose to spend their evenings with ‘Signor Cassali.’”<sup id=\"fnref:47\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>As these examples suggest, British travelers did indeed form relationships with Italian <em>signori</em>. Some of them were strictly financial, as this short but enigmatic entry for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2980\">Isabella Littlejohn</a> (travel year 1790) suggests: “James Byres borrowed money from Isabella Littlejohn (Signora Francesco Tribuzzi) in 1790.” For many travelers, their primary and daily contact with Italians was as their tenants or guests, such as the portrait painter <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2728\">William Keeble</a> (or Keable) (1714–74, travel years 1761–74), who “lived in the house of Domenico Gandolfi” when he was in Bologna. There were also professional relationships. The Irish painter <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/265\">James Barry</a> (1741–1806, travel years 1766–71) attributed his election to the Accademia Clementina “to the obliging dispositions of two friends of mine here, Mr Keable and Signor Bianconi.” Castruccio Bonamici commissioned the same Keeble to paint his portrait in Naples.<sup id=\"fnref:48\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:48\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></sup> Some of these financial arrangements also betray sentimental relationships—such as the annuity left in the will of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/521\">John Bouverie</a> (c. 1722–50, travel years 1741–42, 1745–46, 1749–50) to “Signora Teresa Tacconio of Bologna.” As Jeremy Black has reiterated, the Grand Tour also provided opportunities for sexual experimentation and social transgression for British travelers away from home.<sup id=\"fnref:49\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:49\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></sup> For example, the Third Earl of Peterborough, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3832\">Charles Mordaunt</a> (1658–1735, travel years 1706–7, 1711–12, 1714, 1715, 1716–18, 1719–20) was known to stay in Bologna, “where he has been many times,” for private reasons “regarding his engagement to Signora Catina.” Many of these characters—from Signor Giacomo to Signora Catina—remain unknown, and the unevenness of the use of biographical data in the <em>Dictionary</em> means that these sorts of relationships are sometimes difficult to quantify across the Explorer.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to gauge British engagement with Italian society would be to examine the number of “travelers” who married Italians. In most cases, this implies a reconsideration of terms such as Grand Tourists and travelers (which Brinsley Ford, Ingamells, and their collaborators implicitly did by including British residents in the <em>Dictionary</em>). Further archival research in cities such as Leghorn/Livorno, where there had been a continuous presence of British merchants since the early modern period, would be one way forward, as Simon Macdonald’s research on the British resident community in Paris has so fruitfully shown.<sup id=\"fnref:50\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:50\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">50</a></sup> More research could also be done on the importance of the resident British community that serviced travelers’ needs, their local knowledge commodified for this shifting group of Grand Tourists. In the Explorer, the information regarding marriage is found in the main headings of each entry, although there is not yet a separate category to search this information across entries (while one can of course do such a search within the downloaded data set). A casual search found two Irish Catholics married to Italian women—the dealer <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1652\">Robert Fagan</a>, who lived in Italy for thirty years and was married twice to young Italian women, and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2759\">David Ker</a> (1742–1811, travel years 1792–94), who spent two years in Italy with his three daughters after the death of his Venetian wife, Maddalena Guardi, in 1785.<sup id=\"fnref:51\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:51\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></sup> There is also the case of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/135\">Eliza Ashburner</a> (travel years 1783–1800), “a lady-in-waiting to one of the daughters of the Queen of Naples,” who had married Signor Perconte (a <em>secretario refferendario del Regno</em>) in June 1800, presumably in the aftermath of the rushed retreat of the Bourbon court to Naples. A more focused word search using Italian first names found a number of Britons married to Italians—for example, the search for a common first name, <em>Giovanna</em>, found <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2636\">George Jackson</a> (1692–1763, travel years c. 1713–63), described as a diplomat and merchant in the <em>Dictionary</em>. Married to an Italian Catholic, Mary Joanna Rimaldini, Jackson lived most of his life (fifty years of it) in Leghorn/Livorno and served a two-year stint as the British consul in Genoa; he died in Ancona, presumably while visiting his daughter.<sup id=\"fnref:52\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></sup> Testimony to his rootedness in Italian society is that the cardinal from whom he received special dispensation to marry as a Protestant became Pope Benedict XIV and was the godfather of Jackson’s eldest son, Prospero. George Jackson’s knowledge of Italian culture clearly went beyond polite conversation; he gathered an enormous library of more than three thousand books and manuscripts in Italian and Latin for which he published a catalog in 1756.<sup id=\"fnref:53\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:53\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></sup> Jackson was buried in the English cemetery in Leghorn/Livorno, and his tombstone still carries the spelling mistakes in English of the Italian stone mason who carved it.<sup id=\"fnref:54\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:54\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">54</a></sup> A search for the male equivalent, <em>Giovanni</em>, brings up the husband of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2677\">Anna Maria Jenkins</a> (travel years 1788–94), who spent four years in Rome with her uncle, the antiquary Thomas Jenkins;<sup id=\"fnref:55\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:55\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">55</a></sup> Anna Maria married Giovanni Martinez, “the nephew of Thomas Jenkins’s neighbor on the Corso,” in 1794, but there is no further notice of her life in Italy or in England. Marriage to an Italian, of course, is not the only way to gauge the rootedness of British residents in Italy. The unmarried British Abbés and Monsignors who pop up throughout the <em>Dictionary</em> belie the significant number of British Catholics (including Stuart sympathizers) who made Rome their home over many years. Nonetheless, this directed and random word searching has brought to light a number of Italians whose relationship with Britons went beyond buying art or social visits in aristocratic palaces. In turn, further research could reveal more about British travelers who became residents, sometimes working for British Grand Tourists, occasionally marrying Italians, living out their lives in Italy, and sometimes dying there as well.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"using-data-to-visualize-the-british-experience-in-italy\">Using Data to Visualize the British Experience in Italy</h1>\n\n<p>Might the rich travel data contained in the Explorer offer insights or ways to approach the question of British engagement with Italian urban life? In many ways, the Explorer confirms the well-worn narrative, with the largest number of travelers going to Rome (3,382), followed by Florence (2,154), Venice (2,135), and Naples (1,943). It is common knowledge that travel itineraries on the Grand Tour varied, some travelers completing their travels over a few months, others over a few years, most often with the intention of returning home to Britain. We also know that there were seasonal patterns to visits to particular cities; as Rosemary Sweet reminds us, travelers often went to Naples for Lent to get away from the boredom of Rome or, for shorter periods, to Venice for Carnival.<sup id=\"fnref:56\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:56\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">56</a></sup> Grand Tour itineraries followed these seasonal ebbs and flows; for instance, the liquefaction of San Gennaro’s blood each year on September 22 was a must-see for many tourists, including Jones, who managed to combine his first visit to Naples in September 1778 to time with the feast day of the city’s patron saint and an eruption of Vesuvius.<sup id=\"fnref:57\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:57\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">57</a></sup> The regular eruptions of Vesuvius in the eighteenth century brought visitors to Naples within days, as Goethe notes in his entry from November 24, 1787: “At the moment it seems as if all the art treasures of Rome were of no account; all the foreigners have interrupted their sightseeing tour and are hurrying off to Naples.”<sup id=\"fnref:58\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:58\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">58</a></sup> Further research could track the known eruptions of Vesuvius with the arrival dates of tourists using the Explorer, as well as map the seasonal patterns of visitors to the city according to religious festivals (for example, Lent to Easter) or to the weather (for example, avoiding the intensity of the summer heat or enjoying the mild winter months in Naples).</p>\n\n<p>Yet popularity of “travel places” alone is only one possible approach, and it is complicated by the absences in the archive. First, there is the matter of the often absent details of the journey to and within Italy. We have to assume that most Grand Tourists in the database started their travels in Britain, arriving by land or sea from France, from further east by land, or sailing around Gibraltar. “Gateway” cities, searched as “travel places” in the Explorer, included Turin (951), Milan (590), and Bologna (673) on the way to Rome from France, or Leghorn/Livorno (979, although three for Leghorn/Livorno) if arriving by sea to Florence, or smaller stops such as Terracina (13) on the way to Naples. While tourists must have stopped through many of these cities en route, they appear much less popular than the major destination cities (as “travel places”): this, of course, has to do with the fact that Grand Tourists did not always record their stays in their diaries and memoirs, or that they were not included by Brinsley Ford, Ingamells, and their collaborators, even though we know of the existence of inns that served these popular routes.</p>\n\n<p>The Explorer allows us to take a different approach to the qualities of stays in cities, and, in turn, travelers’ engagement with Italian life. Even within the biography of one traveler, there is variety in the length as well as the quality of visits. Thomas Jones first stayed in Naples for just four months in 1778, but he returned two years later and stayed for three years, until 1783. The first visit in his memoirs records a typical Grand Tour itinerary, with trips to the main sites in and around the city, while his second is taken up by the more mundane business of finding accommodation, moving furniture, and buying paints.<sup id=\"fnref:59\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:59\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">59</a></sup> Continuing to use Jones as our guide, we can look for “travelers” who stayed longer in any city and who might have engaged more substantially with Italian urban life.</p>\n\n<p>The absences in the archive continue to shape the possibilities and results of such an exploration. Data often remains incomplete for travelers who did not keep diaries as detailed as Jones’s or whose best records remain in Italian archives, unincorporated in the <em>Dictionary</em>. Some indicate approximate dates of stay or just a year, while others give exact dates of stays; compare, for instance, Jones’s “travels” with his friend William Pars’s in the Explorer, whose dates were partially reconstructed by using Jones’s “Memoirs.” All in all, about a quarter of travelers are recorded with enough detail to calculate their duration of stay (1,450 of 6,007).<sup id=\"fnref:60\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:60\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">60</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Figures 5 and 6 replicate many of the noted patterns across the data. Figure 5 demonstrates that Rome, Florence, Venice, and Naples all recorded a number of visitors roughly proportionate to the whole of the Explorer data. Figure 6 shows the median number of days per visit to each of the cities. While Naples had only the fourth-largest number of visitors, the average length of stay in the city (43 days) was nearly as long as that in Rome (50.5) and far longer than all other popular cities.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../calaresu-figure-5.svg\" id=\"fig5\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap5&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap5\">\n\nFig. 5.

While diplomats, merchants, painters, and statesmen represent some of the most numerous groups, there are still significant limitations to the dating of their travels. The long residencies of men such as George Jackson as a merchant in Leghorn/Livorno stand out immediately; in fact, only three merchants have precise enough dating to be included within the subset, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/612\">N. Brooke</a> (travel years 1786–97), <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/916\">George Chetham</a> (1678–1701, travel years 1700–1701), and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2238\">Christopher Hanbury</a> (c. 1661–1716, travel years 1704–16). We know anecdotally and from current research that focuses on Rome that artists spent extensive periods of time—in some cases, their entire working life—in the city.<sup id=\"fnref:61\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:61\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">61</a></sup> But the result for a city like Leghorn/Livorno is harder to read. Nonetheless the length of stay in Naples across these occupation groups indicates the greater depth of British engagement with the urban life in Naples by Grand Tourists.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-7a\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"../calaresu-figure-7a.svg\" id=\"fig7a\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig7b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<a name=\"figure-7b\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"../calaresu-figure-7b.svg\" id=\"fig7b\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig7a&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<a name=\"figure-7c\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"../calaresu-figure-7c.svg\" id=\"fig7c\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig7d&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<a name=\"figure-7d\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"../calaresu-figure-7d.svg\" id=\"fig7d\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig7c&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap7\">\n\nFig. 7. The median number of days spent in each city by occupation of traveler, in clockwise order for diplomats, merchants, painters, and statesmen. While cases such as the merchants of Leghorn/Livorno become difficult to compare, we can note the generally lengthy stays in Rome and Naples across occupations. (Click top two images or bottom two images to expand either set, respectively.)\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The Explorer allows us to easily compare the death dates of travelers against their time of travel to the city as another potential indicator of length of stay. While more Britons “saw Rome and died” (64), there were a considerable number of British travelers who can be inferred to have died in Naples (40)—which echoes the expression in Italian, <em>Vedi Napoli e muore</em>. There were more deaths proportionally in Naples than in Florence (22) and Venice (17) where visitors often stayed for less time. In fact, the next largest number of British deaths after those in Rome and Naples are those in Leghorn/Livorno (70), which represents 7.2 percent of the overall number of travelers to the Tuscan port (977). At first glance, the number of deaths in Leghorn/Livorno appears representative of the resident community of merchants who, like <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2636\">George Jackson</a>, lived their adult life there and became old in the city and of the rich sources about the Leghorn/Livorno cemeteries available to the <em>Dictionary</em>’s compilers, which is not available for other cities. Alternatively, it might have to do with the fact that British ships stopped in the port on their way to Britain, as it seems was the case for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2874\">Edward</a> (c. 1791–97, travel year 1797) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2874.2\">Richard Lee</a> (c. 1792–97, travel year 1797), who died at ages six and four years on their way from Smyrna, having lost their sister (c. 1792–97, travel year 1797) in Naples on the way.<sup id=\"fnref:62\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:62\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">62</a></sup> We know that many British travelers in poor health went to Naples with the belief that the mild climate of the city would improve their health, and we know that some of these “invalids” died there.<sup id=\"fnref:63\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:63\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">63</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>As these final figures demonstrate, British Grand Tourists engaged with Italian society beyond the buying of antiquities and visiting of churches on the shorter visits that were common in most of the cities of the Grand Tour. The evidence from Naples shows that many tourists stayed longer. Like Rome, Naples offered many opportunities for tourists and, to some extent, artists; this might have changed over time, of course, as the sites of Herculaneum and Pompeii and their excavated treasures became unique draws to the city by the end of the eighteenth century. The evocative memoirs and paintings of Thomas Jones clearly demonstrate the depth of the British engagement with Italian cityscapes, particularly that of Naples. The Explorer provides several methods for putting that knowledge in a greater context, helping us to better understand whether Thomas Jones’s engagement with the city was as exceptional as it seems.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h1>\n\n<p>For their advice or bibliographical help in the writing of this essay, I would like to thank John Gallagher, Simon Macdonald, Renaud Morieux, Katie Scott, Simon Schaffer, and especially Tim Spiers.

The author writes that Jackson was able to build up his library with the help of Padre Alessandro Politi, who found rare books and manuscripts in Italian convents and then sold them “a prezzo carissimo agl’Inglesi” (see the pages preceding the frontispiece of Bonaventura Giovenazzi, <em>Catalogus Librorum Italicorum, Latinorum, et Manuscriptorum, magno sumptu, et labore per triginta annorum spatium Liburni Collectorum</em> (Livorno, 1756), Coll.

        "content"  : "<p>My interest in the Grand Tour explorer arises out of my own work on the engagement of British travelers with Italian cities during the long eighteenth century. Some years ago, I published a book that concentrated upon British experiences and representations of Italian cities during the long eighteenth century, Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c. 1690-1820.1 As an urban historian, I was less concerned with what was collected or purchased by travelers, or with their social networks, than with exploring how images of major Italian cities were constructed and considering their influence in British culture. Given the opportunity to work with the Grand Tour Explorer, I wanted to use it to pursue several questions.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Like many historians, years of immersion in the primary sources meant that I had an intuitive sense of evolving patterns of travel and the composition of the traveling body. However, I was unable to provide any rigorous quantifiable basis for my conclusions or generalizations. How far were my generalizations borne out by the evidence of the Explorer, while taking into account the complex nature of its data, which we know to be far from complete (see the introduction of the book)? What new light could the Explorer cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the Explorer tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body? The dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste, acquired and polished in Italy, exercised such a powerful influence upon Britain’s eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.2 But it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic grand tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out throughout my book was the increasing presence of both female travelers and travelers from beyond the landed elite over the course of the eighteenth century, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book: Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile: such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa and Leghorn.</p>\n"

It has long been known who is represented here: the jauntily leaning central figure is Charles Turner, the original owner of the painting, and on his left he is supported by Sir William Lowther. Seated to their left is Lord Bruce, and the figure standing in between is Thomas Steavens (who, as close examination reveals and sources confirm, was added expertly after the others were already painted). On the far left is Sir Thomas Kennedy, talking with the Irish peer of the group, James Caulfield, 1st Earl of Charlemont.<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>All these men were indeed in Rome on the Grand Tour in their early twenties, and all belonged to the group, led by Lord Charlemont, that sponsored the establishment in 1752 of an academy in Rome to support British artists—a short-lived institution credited as an inspiration for the Royal Academy, founded in London in 1768. Lord Charlemont can be considered the most prominent of the six: he stayed abroad, mostly in Rome, for almost nine years, serving as patron to numerous British and Italian artists, collecting profusely, and socializing with both travelers and Italian notables. He returned home and became a leading political figure of his day while commissioning and championing the construction of various classically inspired buildings that even today mark Ireland’s built environment. To varying degrees, the other five also went on to occupy political positions, join learned societies, and collect and sponsor art and architecture inspired by their tours.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from three minuscule local stock figures in the painting’s background, no others can be seen. Completely invisible are those who made these British Mi’Lords’ travels possible: tutors, servants, and staff, as well as the many others with whom they interacted en route—Britons but also Italians and other foreign travelers and residents. Women are nowhere to be found, although art historians have determined (after four mistaken attempts at attribution) that, ironically, the painting itself was the work of Katherine Read, one of the very few female artists who traveled and worked in Italy in the eighteenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Both Charlemont and Lord Bruce were also admirers of the musical accomplishments and regular visitors of another woman, the Irish traveler Miss Eugenia Peters. Charlemont, moreover, is attested as having had, at one point during his time in Rome, “four Italian servants, his Irish valet,” and two additional English employees.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> The other five men likewise met, socialized, and traveled with a wide range of people, many also from far less privileged social and economic backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p>More glaring, but also to an extent more identifiable, are omissions today apparent in Johan Joseph Zoffany’s famous painting <em>The Tribuna of the Uffizi</em>, with its more crowded cast of mostly young touring British elites, likewise engaged in the conspicuous consumption of Italy’s classical past (fig. 2). Zoffany shows us a couple of tutors, artists, a diplomat, and a military officer, but again there are no women, no members of the lower classes, and no locals or Italians present but for the director of the Uffizi himself, Pietro Bastianelli, holding the famous Venus by Titian for the visitors’ inspection. Thanks to Bastianelli’s administration, we have archival records for the Uffizi in these years showing that visitors skewed aristocratic and foreign, with the British in the majority. But these same records show that many foreigners’ visits were by women, that a good number toured with Italians as guides or companions, and that more artists came on their own to study and copy works in the collection. The scene would also have included Italians from Florence and other cities and states, and among the Florentines there would have been nonelites, who may have ranged from dancers to cooks, from fishmongers (a certain <em>Baccani pesciaiolo</em>) to anonymous women upholsterers (<em>tappeziera</em>). The Uffizi’s archival records contain specifics for only about half of the visitors, and we can imagine that those who have been recorded are generally the more socially distinguished, but visits to the museum are also attested in servants’ journals that have been recently published.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-2\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-1/figure-2.png\" alt=\"Oil painting depicting an interior room of the Uffizi Gallery filled with detailed renderings of famous Renaissance paintings and sculptures.

We learn also about them after their travels: two died shortly after returning from Italy; of the other four, two are better known for their scholarly attainments, and both in time were elected to the Royal Society and the Society of Dilettanti, but all went into occupations of power and wealth.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, information about other travelers with whom they associated, and the other <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22travelPlace%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Rome%22%7D%5D%7D,%22travelDate%22:%7B%22startYear%22:%221751%22,%22endYear%22:%221752%22%7D%7D\">121 travelers</a> known to have been in Rome in 1751 and 1752, is here readily available, recreating an expanded social context. Those most immediately associated with the six travelers may themselves have been members of the elite, but Italian and British artists were their most numerous points of connection (see fig. 3). Also in the mix were some diplomats, who remain important sources of information about the travelers who relied on them during their journeys. The graph in figure 3 reveals connections to even wider networks, which begin to encompass women, as well as tutors and servants who were Italian, British, and Irish.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-1/figure-3.svg\" alt=\"Detailed relationship chart connecting various 18th-century English aristocrats, royals and historical figures.

The Explorer’s principal source is the <em>Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy, 1701–1800</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells and published in 1997.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> An archive of archives, so to speak, the <em>Dictionary</em> has a decades-long <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/archive-to-explorer\">history of its own</a>. The Explorer recasts this unique prosopographical reference as a dynamic resource with search, browsing, visualization, and other interactive features—including the ability to download information in any number of configurations—that allow researchers to study travelers’ lives and journeys anew. At the same time, it reveals a vast array of previously unknown or overlooked Grand Tour travelers, decentering the elite and well-known by bringing into the story hundreds of women, servants, workers, and Italians not represented among the original <em>Dictionary</em>’s primary headings, even if they appear within its textual entries. Thus, the 4,992 biographical entries compiled by the <em>Dictionary</em> has increased, through the Explorer, to 6,007.</p>\n\n<p><em>A World Made by Travel</em> aims to share data with scholars and other users both at scale and in response to particular questions, synthesizing a reference work with original research in an interactive online format. Its distinctive contribution is to harness tools and practices emerging in the new field of digital history to transform and enrich our understanding of eighteenth-century, particularly British, travel to Italy—both its historical significance and its continuing influence. More broadly, the project showcases and makes accessible to researchers, students, and the general public the possibilities of digital history in a digital format, as demonstrated through data, maps, interactive visualizations, digitized archival records, original research essays, and other tools that raise new questions and forge new connections with unprecedented granularity. <em>A World Made by Travel</em> poses a set of evolving answers to the question of what it means to do historical research digitally, in particular with historical data concerning thousands of lives.</p>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">* * *</h2>\n\n<p>The Grand Tour at the heart of <em>A World Made by Travel</em> is that of British travelers journeying to Italy. As Britain’s global reach spread during the course of the eighteenth century, more and more Britons undertook this travel. Exact numbers are hard to come by, as there is not a single archive for British travelers to the Continent, but estimates put the number at more than ten thousand per year.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The eighteenth century has indeed been hailed as the golden age of the Grand Tour, but it is important to remember that Continental travel for education, tourism, and art collecting existed well before and after this period. The term <em>Grand Tour</em> itself was coined by Richard Lassels—a British tutor who visited Italy five times with different charges—in 1670, in his immensely successful and long-lasting travel guide <em>The Voyage of Italy</em>, and British elites had traveled to Italy as tourists since the Renaissance. Nor did the end of the eighteenth century see the end of such travel. Although the age of revolutions and the Napoleonic wars certainly disrupted itineraries and practices of Continental travel, these interruptions, alongside changes brought about by technology—including, in time, the steamboat and then the train—deeply transformed travel to Italy. But they did not diminish it; if anything, journeys to Italy grew more frequent and numerous in the nineteenth century, and the transformation into mass tourism was a long and complex one.</p>\n\n<p>Nor was the Grand Tour limited geographically to Italy. Lassels himself recommended the tour of Italy as part of a longer itinerary, debating the merits of touring France, Germany, or Holland on the way to or from Italy. There was of course no direct way to Italy (if not by sea), but it is also true that these other places were destinations in and of themselves, whether Italy was reached or not. Paris saw many more British visitors than Italy, sometimes due to monetary constraints, while others also went beyond Italy, using it as a launching pad for destinations farther beyond in the Mediterranean. Finally, it was not just Britons traveling. Archives tell us as much: the Uffizi’s records, for example, show many French visitors, as well as other Europeans and travelers from other continents, from North America to North Africa.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>A fluid historical experience like the Grand Tour is hard to fit into strict geographical, chronological, or national boundaries. Goethe, a German, visited Italy in the late 1780s but did not publish his most influential account—<em>Italienisch Reise</em>, among whose most vivid pages are those set in that British center of sociability and collecting that was Sir William Hamilton’s house in Naples—until 1816. The <em>Dictionary</em> itself, focused as it is on the British and Irish in Italy from 1701 to 1800, seeps beyond its own margins—something that the computational and data approach makes very clear, highlighting locations outside Italy, dates before and after the eighteenth century, and many people beyond the British and Irish travelers of its title.</p>\n\n<p>While using <em>Grand Tour</em> to refer, in particular, to eighteenth-century British travel to Italy and the sustained conversation that, in the eighteenth century and since, centered it, <em>A World Made by Travel</em> acknowledges this wider context. Indeed, there were nearly as many pathways to Italy, and as many reasons for traveling there, as there were travelers who undertook the journey. <em>A World Made by Travel</em> seeks to honor the variety of people who collectively constituted this distinctive world, while also keeping an eye on the widely shared sense at the time that an Italian journey—particularly when imperial power was shifting from the South toward the North and the West—held the key to becoming a citizen of the world.</p>\n\n<p>For cultural and social elites in the late eighteenth century, that phrase—“a citizen of the world”—succinctly captured the allure of Italy. As the English critic Samuel Johnson remarked, “A man who has not been in Italy, is always conscious of an inferiority, from his not having seen what it is expected a man should see.”<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup>  Dotted with the monuments that elites knew from their reading of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and populated by influential contemporaries who might be encountered in the flesh, the Italian Peninsula promised an educational rite of passage rooted in humanist ideals of classical origin, while fostering the transformation of antiquarian interest for the past into modern practices of knowledge. Every journey, however, involved many other people, including (despite Johnson’s masculine language) women—a fact that highlights important questions about who gets remembered and how their journeys are interpreted.</p>\n\n<p>The story of the Grand Tour of Italy is a story of nations as well as of individuals. As such, it holds enormous cultural and historiographical significance today. To study this transformative historical phenomenon, to think about its participants and recreate their paths, is to encounter an increasingly diffuse learned community whose travels helped shape the modern world as we know it. This was a community of travelers consisting of reluctant youths and intrepid women, of scientists and artists, of the Enlightenment’s most sensitive minds and influential writers, and of many other (mostly unnamed) figures. Among them were diplomats, merchants, sea captains, doctors, governesses, and servants, who made these travels possible and who may not have been seeking an educational rite of passage at all—who, instead, sought professional advancement, or a way to make a living, or who did not even travel by choice. The countless crossing of paths that constituted this world of travel—its multifarious exchanges of material objects as well as ideas and interactions, many planned but as many unexpected—contributed to a massive reimagining of politics and the arts, of diplomacy, of the market for culture, of ideas about leisure, and of professional practices such as archaeology and the teaching and collecting of art.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the Grand Tour, despite being a fundamental engine of modern life, has long posed a considerable historiographical challenge. Our grasp on this phenomenon today is constrained by the widely dispersed documents through which we can study and come to know it. Not that there is a shortage of existing texts. Many travelers kept journals and wrote letters, a number of which were published at the time, and those published “travels” were themselves shaped not just by ancient texts but also by previous travelers’ accounts. Even these texts, however, account for the travels of only a fraction of those who voyaged to the Italian Peninsula in these years. So while the enormous scale of the Grand Tour, with numerous individuals traveling across a vast geography, is well understood today—indeed, this is seen as a crucial feature of its influence—the fact remains that when we define and understand it through the writings of only a small selection of travelers, we barely glimpse its scope.</p>\n\n<p>Written accounts, published or in manuscript, offer merely a trace of the record left behind by Grand Tour travel. Archival records are widely dispersed throughout Italy and Britain, and an extraordinary amount of visual evidence remains, even down to the painted depiction of individual travelers (to have one’s portrait painted in Italy, whether at full scale or in miniature, was a sought-after experience). Such records, though, can suppress as much as they reveal. Because the Italian Grand Tour, a formative institution of modernity, was constituted by the movement of <em>people</em>, relying on only the most well-known accounts and depictions risks ignoring much of its actual life and enormous subsequent impact.</p>\n\n<p>Access to more stories expands the scope of our knowledge, but the act of counting is always tied to decisions about what to count, interpretive acts of categorization, and, thanks to the richly documented and multidimensional character of our data, how different categories intersect. Only thus can the lives and journeys of travelers otherwise hard to ascertain be brought to bear in the same picture and narrative. Data visualization and data analysis allow us to see many more people than before. In this approach, which is committed to the interplay between the qualitative and the quantitative, we can establish a new sensitivity to the unknown players in our historical past. When historians began dreaming, with the advent of the personal computer in the early 1990s, of the new possibilities of processing large amounts of data quickly and easily and of exchanging data sets and information via machines, they could scarcely imagine the ease of today’s file transfers or the dynamic web applications that allow us to zoom in and out from individuals to groups, draw networks and connections, and manipulate categories in our explorations. Yet this exponential computational growth and the advent of artificial intelligence have revealed all the more the importance of careful source and data criticism. To quote Mateusz Fafinski: “Historical data is not a kitten, it’s a saber-toothed tiger” that will undermine any work not attending to its complex uncertainties and missing records.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> A dynamic digital tool like the Grand Tour Explorer opens exciting vistas on and approaches to eighteenth-century British travel to Italy, but doing research with historical data requires as much scholarly attention and care as traditional historical research.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-new-world-of-grand-tour-studies\">The New World of Grand Tour Studies</h1>\n\n<p><em>A World Made by Travel</em> builds on a tremendous groundswell of exciting scholarly work undertaken in recent decades on the nature and meaning of the multifaceted world of travel to Italy.</p>\n\n<p>For a long time, research on travel was difficult to fit into academic institutions, and it is perhaps partly for this reason that crossover work of interest to a wider public and conducted by independent scholars has filled the gap.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> The elaborately researched surveys by Christopher Hibbert and Jeremy Black, successful as they were in the trade press, also heralded a new academic turn.<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup> In the 1990s, as interdisciplinarity flourished, Grand Tour Studies reemerged and attracted cultural historians seeking to forge connections among intellectual, political, and art history and bringing sophisticated literary analysis to bear on seemingly mundane travel writings. Exhibitions in London, Rome, and Philadelphia put on literal display the Grand Tour’s potential as a subject of interdisciplinary scholarship, telling its story through paintings, ancient and modern sculpture, and touristic artifacts ranging from prints to painted fans. The lavishly produced and illustrated catalogs of these exhibitions, as well as the edited volumes based on related conferences, brought together scholars from disparate disciplines to provide context and analysis.<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> This moment also comenced a season of research, as scholars such as Philip Ayres, Jonathan Scott, Viccy Coltman, Jason Kelly, Ruth Guilding, and Joan Coutu investigated a broad cultural dialogue about republican <em>virtù</em> and neoclassical taste, studying the complex and richly cultivated ideals embodied in the artifacts collected by Grand Tourists: from marble busts of themselves, commissioned in Rome and made to resemble ancient Roman statues, to Greek painted vases used to decorate their sitting rooms, often atop mantelpieces of neoclassical design.<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>As an institution, the Grand Tour was established on the original humanist belief that classical education forged modern men. Not all Grand Tourists were seen as manifesting the ideal: Lady Montagu, for instance, lamented the vulgarity of the English youth she encountered, and tutors frequently complained about their unruly charges.<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> Other instances of disappointment offer further proof of the paradox, as described in essential works by Chloe Chard and Bruce Redford, respectively, exploring foreign modes of experiencing travel in Italy in general and Venice in particular.<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> Melissa Calaresu and Nelson Moe have analyzed foreign representations of Italian decline that situate Italy on the margins of modernity, though they do so in order to interrogate the limits of Enlightenment ideals of cosmopolitanism.<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup> Others, including Paula Findlen, have unmasked this mediated, imaginary Italy in a way that allows for a clearer view of the vibrant modernity of eighteenth-century Italian culture.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> These penetrating investigations of the Grand Tour’s ideals and cultural dynamics have recently led to a sustained look at the lived reality of the Grand Tour.</p>\n\n<p>John Brewer, in asking “Whose Grand Tour?,” launched an investigation of collecting practices and how they changed across the eighteenth century. He also sounded a clear call to open up investigations of travels to Italy beyond the narratives dominated by wealthy young men.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup> What sorts of reactions did different Italian cities elicit from travelers, and how did the travels of women differ from those of men? Questions such as these animate Rosemary Sweet’s recent work.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup> A 2012 exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford of items from the cargo of the British merchant ship <em>Westmorland</em>, which was reconstructed as an ensemble thanks to painstaking work on the archival records of its 1779 capture during the Anglo-French wars, put on display a vivid cross-section of the Grand Tour in keeping with this recent scholarly turn. The ship’s contents—including works of art acquired by Grand Tourists, notebooks and personal possessions, and luxury market goods such as silk, olives, and thirty-two wheels of Parmesan cheese—offer detailed insight into the tastes and interests not just of Grand Tourists in general but also of specific travelers. The fascination with such particulars connects some of the most recent work to that of one of the very first scholars to cultivate the Grand Tour in academia, Edward Chaney, whose collected essays painstakingly examined, case study by case study, its various contexts.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>More recent work zeroes in on lived experiences and unexplored or unquestioned facets of the Grand Tour world. Scholars have focused on the places visited before and after Italy, readdressing the significance of travel in countries north of the Alps, given that many who left England did not make it all the way, that those who reached Italy by land spent much of their time in other locations en route, and that Italians themselves sometimes traveled north.<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup> Other scholars have plumbed archives old and new with great creativity to throw light on what preceded and followed travel in the lives of travelers. Richard Ansell has carefully explored how families strategized about their offsprings’ travel and what the educational, social, and financial outcomes of that travel were through subsequent generations. Sarah Goldsmith’s research on how masculinity was constructed through traveling posits anew the role of the Grand Tour in shaping British elites. Recent work on country houses and libraries—investigating the integration of imported objects, habits, and books in British genteel living—also extends our understanding of the afterlives of travel beyond art collecting.<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Ilaria Bignamini already posed the crucial question of the role of Italians and Italian culture in the Grand Tour in 1996.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup> Careful readings of sources have shed light on the Tour’s Italian contexts and on practices of acculturation, from Arturo Tosi’s study of language acquisition to Calaresu’s research on cooking habits.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> Collaboration with Italian scholars has proved illuminating in this respect, from the already mentioned work by Findlen to the joint study by Paola Bianchi and Karen Wolfe of Turin’s academy. The Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerche sul Viaggio in Italia has done remarkable work in the field, and Cesare De Seta’s thesis on the influence of the Italy envisioned by travelers on Italians’ self-image is at the core of the most recent and most expansive art exhibition on the Grand Tour, “Grand Tour: Sogno d’Italia da Venezia a Pompei,” presented in Milan in 2021 and 2022.<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> Attilio Brilli has for decades pushed the field forward by bringing his prolific academic research to a broader public, culminating in the multilingual and multiauthored <em>The Grand Tour of Europe</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Deep dives into Italian archival sources, along with new analyses of well-known travelers’ accounts, have also added original texture and facilitated new disciplinary connections. One example is Brewer’s recent masterful article on the making of scientific knowledge through a study of the local guides taking visitors up Vesuvius, a story which, moreover, in his most recent <em>Volcanic: Vesuvius in the Age of Revolutions</em>, shows the integration of politics, imagination, arts, and sciences engendered by this world of travel.<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> Historians of art and of science, and of eighteenth-century Italy in general, have also provided essential new contexts within which better understand travel to Italy in the eighteenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup> The image of the Grand Tour has indeed far expanded in scope from the original focus on travel by wealthy young men and on art collecting, as more participants come into view. While Brian Dolan’s work focused on the “ladies’” Grand Tour, more recent scholarship is foregrounding the great variety of possible women’s travel experience. Explorations of nonelite travelers’ and servants’ experiences are also starting to be explored, both by reading anew well-known travel accounts, as in the work of Kathryn Walchester, and by the rare recovery of servants’ travel accounts from the archive, thanks to the research of George Boulukos and Richard Ansell.<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup></p>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">* * *</h2>\n\n<p>The original print <em>Dictionary</em> facilitated research that used a prosopographical approach to push beyond the stereotype of the Grand Tourist as male, young, and elite. John Brewer’s field-shaping essay “Whose Grand Tour?” was argued through close reading of the <em>Dictionary</em>, quoting from as many as forty of its entries. In the same volume in which Brewer’s essay appeared, moreover, María Dolores Sánchez-Jáuregui wrote on the neglected figures of governors or “bear leaders”—travel companions to younger, wealthy elite men, who directed their studies, managed the logistics and finances of their travels, and often influenced their collecting choices. Sánchez-Jáuregui was inspired by her research on the <em>Westmorland</em>, the so-called English Prize, whose cargo contained evidence of bear leaders’ activities. But it was the <em>Dictionary</em> that confirmed for her the value and possibilities of the subject and served her as a major source of information for about 174 tutors.</p>\n\n<p><em>A World Made by Travel</em> pushes even further in this direction of expansion. Although its starting point is the abundance of detail in the <em>Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em>, the Grand Tour Explorer makes it possible to investigate all travelers, despite scarce or uncertain information, including those effectively hidden until now. The <em>Dictionary</em> is animated by an unusually wide cast of characters, which in part is a testament to the eclectic collecting and research interests of Ford and the many who worked with him to build his archive of travelers, but the Explorer increases this cast by more than a thousand, of which well more than half are women.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the many stereotypically wealthy Grand Tourists, there are entries for students of the arts and resident artists, humanists (whether scholars of manuscripts or antiquities), merchants, military men, diplomats, and Jacobite exiles. The variable length of the entries reflects differences in what is known about individual travelers, both during and beyond their travels. Many of the longest entries belong to familiar figures whose tours are substantively documented, such as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3395\">Lady Montagu</a> (1689–1762, travel years 1718, 1739–41, 1746–61) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2219\">Sir William Hamilton</a> (1730–1803, travel years 1764–1800). Less-famous figures who nonetheless left behind precise documentation of their travels—such as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2488\">Patrick Home</a> (1728–1808, travel years 1750–51, 1771-77) and the artist <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1276\">Richard Dalton</a> (1713?–91, travel years 1739–43, 1747–50, 1758–59, 1762–63, 1768–69, 1774–75)—also have lengthy entries, as do people who stayed long in Italy. Well-known figures whose tours were neither extensive nor thoroughly documented, however, such as the philosopher <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2575\">David Hume</a> (1711–76, travel year 1748), whose journey ended at Turin, warrant briefer entries.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there are travelers about whom almost nothing is known. At times only their names survive, and even these might be uncertain (but are still included). This is the case, for example, for a few of the artists mentioned in the crucial and mysterious document known as “Hayward’s List,” which consists of “a gathering of ten octavo-sized pages stitched together” that records in neat handwriting the names and the arrivals of British artists in Rome from 1753 to 1775.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> Taken together, the Grand Tour Explorer’s entries allow <em>A World Made by Travel</em> to present a newly expansive sense of the Grand Tour’s diversity. This is a world much more densely populated than what we see in the individual journals of Grand Tourists or much of the scholarship based on them, yet on that is fully consonant with the findings of recent Grand Tour studies.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-explorer\">The Explorer</h1>\n\n<p>Creating the Grand Tour Explorer was a multiyear, multistep, iterative, and collaborative process. Not only the tool but the process itself grew in scale and complexity alongside contemporary technological developments—a story recounted in detail in “<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/archive-to-explorer\">Archive to Explorer</a>.” Offered here is an explanation of the nature of the Explorer and the stakes of the transformation it represents from print source to digital data to an online and interactive research resource, as well as an introduction to the new approach that it enables for the study of eighteenth-century travel to Italy.</p>\n\n<p>At the core of the Explorer, as of the <em>Dictionary</em>, is the individual entry. Atomized content organized around the lives of individuals has long been the foundation of prosopographies. The Grand Tour Explorer pushes this principle further than its print source. Where some entries in the <em>Dictionary</em> might have had headings representing two or more people—for example, husbands and wives or other groupings—these have been broken down in the Explorer into individual entries, with one for each traveler. (There are some <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/archive-to-explorer#paragraph-125\">exceptions</a>, such as where a lack of information made it impossible to identify individual travelers.) Cutting against the principle of individuation in the Explorer, however, is a thoroughgoing practice of interconnection, by virtue of various links (based on data points such as dates, places, and occupations shared by multiple travelers, to name a few) that encourage movement from one entry to another, in digital fashion. Yet at every stage, the transformation of the (print) <em>Dictionary</em> into the (online, digital) Grand Tour Explorer has required thinking through and deciding what may be lost as well as gained by moving a prosopography from page to screen. This is therefore also a story about biographical dictionaries in the digital era.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Biographical dictionaries are not meant to be read from start to finish. In libraries they have traditionally sat among other dictionaries and encyclopedias in reference rooms, where information is organized and stored for easy consultation. Their structure is governed by the fact of their atomized content and arranged under headings, typically ordered alphabetically. In print, these dictionaries also lend themselves to cross-referencing. For example, some reference works put terms in bold to indicate a separate but related entry; in the case of the <em>Dictionary</em>, references to other entries are made by directing the reader to “see [<em>x</em>].”</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, cross-referencing in online biographical dictionaries has gone well beyond the possibilities afforded by specific hypertext links, which constituted the initial added feature when text first moved online. For instance, born-digital Wikipedia has grown into the largest-ever encyclopedia in only twenty years, particularly on account of how it facilitates searching and sorting, allows and encourages reading as consultation, and enables readers to move across diverse kinds of content. Some have questioned whether it will even be possible for traditional reference works (such as a national biographical dictionary) to survive in this new context and have wondered what changes could help them to adapt to the online environment.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> <em>The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em> (<em>ODNB</em>) has been at the forefront of this conversation since its appearance online in 2004. It has survived in part through annual updates regularly adding new lives. The marvel of its searching capabilities, which awed reviewers on its very first appearance—“it is hard to think of any subject not illuminated by running word search through this colossal database,” wrote Keith Thomas at the time<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup>—has only improved. Such are the wonders of metadata that readers now can search the <em>ODNB</em>’s lives by twenty different occupations, eight religious affiliations, and many of the locations and dates that appear within the biographies. Using a sidebar on the left, one can reach a desired entry, and within each entry, the names of people in blue represent hyperlinks to other entries. This ongoing discussion around and experimentation with online biographical dictionaries is the context within which we have transformed the print <em>Dictionary</em> into the digital Grand Tour Explorer.</p>\n\n<p>So what do the Explorer’s entries look like? <a href=\"#figure-4\">Figure 4</a> shows an individual entry—in this case, that of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/0\">Charles Abbot</a> (1757–1829, travel year 1788), the alphabetized print <em>Dictionary</em>’s very first entry.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-1/figure-4.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Entry page for Charles Abbot in the Explorer, showing biographical and relational data on the left, the text of the Dictionary’s entry in the center, and a map and list of places on the right.\" id=\"fig4\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap4&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\nFig. 4. Example of an entry in the Explorer. This entry, dedicated to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/0\">Charles Abbot</a>, is the first one in alphabetical order among the 6,007 in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%7D\">Explorer</a> database, and serves as an example: in the center is the reproduction of the entry from the print text of the <i>Dictionary</i>, flanked by, on the left, a column with the biographical and indexical data and, on the right side, the travel data, including an interactive minimap showing places visited by the traveler.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>In the center is the text of the entry as it appears in the print version, preserving it down to the typography, and providing at the end a link to find the relevant material in the Brinsley Ford archive. This text, however, is flanked on either side by information derived from the print entry itself and formalized as data. The right-hand sidebar contains data about the travels (the sequence of recorded dates and places visited), as well as an animated map that visualizes this data. The left-hand sidebar contains the traveler’s biographical details, names of other travelers mentioned in the entry, and the entry’s sources—all sorted and grouped under the relevant category of data. Readers can scroll through all the entries in alphabetical order by moving with the arrow in the above banner right or left, similar to flipping through pages of the print <em>Dictionary</em>. They can also navigate from one entry to another, and they can explore several different entries by clicking on the links contained in the two flanking columns. Any name in hyperlinked font—a spouse, a parent, or any other associated traveler—is clickable and will take the reader to that traveler’s entry. Any of the other data points that appear clickable—for example, an occupation, a biographical date, a source on the left-hand side, or a place and time of travel on the right-hand side—will open up a list of all other entries that share that specific data point. Thus, a reader can easily navigate to (for example) a shared occupation (painter, member of Parliament, etc.) or to all other travelers born in a specific year or in a specific place at a specific time. On the Explore page, where all the categories of data appear as search fields, one can filter and browse in order to access all the corresponding entries. One can also explore multiple categories at once—for example, for travelers known to have traveled to Pisa and Rome between 1772 to 1775 who also happened to be members of the Royal Society.</p>\n\n<p>Given the significance of space to travel, the print <em>Dictionary</em> includes two maps to orient readers: a historical one from 1799, which shows roads and states at the time; and a modern one that includes more locations, but still falls short of including every place mentioned in the text or all the boundaries of the eighteenth-century states into which Italy was divided at the time. This is a difficulty shared by all works trying to convey the complexity of the political structure of eighteenth-century Italy, divided as it was into various states whose boundaries fluctuated. The Explorer map shown in figure 5 digitally resolves, in part, some of these issues. All locations in the database are present but become visible only when zooming in to avoid crowding and overlapping of labels. Rather than drawn boundaries on the map, the political entities are presented via different colors for locations, according to the states to which they belonged.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-1/figure-5.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Explorer’s map page, showing all places where travelers in the database are recorded having traveled using color-coded dots.

Map view of places of travel in the Explorer data. This map is one of the Explorer’s main pages and shows all places where travelers in the database are recorded having traveled. These include locations outside of Italy, marked by white dots. The dots marking the places of travel within Italy are color coded to represent the thirteen politically independent states in which the Italian peninsula was divided in the eighteenth century. The map’s interactivity allows a reader to click on a place name to generate in the Explorer a list of travelers recorded in the database as having traveled there.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The map serves as a reference for readers: by typing in the search box any place mentioned in the Explorer, its location is shown. The map also operates as an additional interactive layer in the reading of this digital transformation of the print <em>Dictionary</em>: to click on any of the locations displayed among the database’s places of travel on the map is to be taken to a list of entries of the travelers who are recorded as having visited that location.</p>\n\n<p>The list of entries is fundamental to the reader’s experience of the Grand Tour Explorer. Whether appearing as a vertical list showing the heading and first line of each entry, which readers can scroll as if they were reading an index, or as a horizontal scroll connecting one entry to the next, which readers can move along as if they were flipping the pages of a book, the list of entries is an essential touchstone. There is great power in this ability to explore and browse by multiple dimensions and readily access the results of these explorations in the form of lists of travelers’ entries. One downside to this digital transformation, however, is the loss of an immediate, physical sense of the whole print <em>Dictionary</em>. Readers know from experience what it means to hold a thick, weighty volume in one’s hands and to flip through its pages; they get a tangible sense of the abundant information and (in the case of a biographical dictionary) of the numerous lives that it contains. The physical experience of a book can also reveal, at a glance, the disparities in the information available for different individuals. One might notice that a certain individual’s entry is spread across several pages, while another’s is compactly contained in a single paragraph. This can even make certain imbalances, such as those of gender representation, immediately apparent: in a printed biographical dictionary, one might flip through pages and pages without encountering a single woman’s name among the entries.</p>\n\n<p>The dot visualization in the Grand Tour Explorer, shown in figures 6a and 6b, aims to convey a similar, if necessarily imperfect, sense of the database as a whole. This interactive visualization is designed to show all the travelers’ entries simultaneously and allow for sizing, sorting, and coloring to represent the variation in entry lengths, a process that is more immediately apparent in print, as well as the gender imbalance that one might grasp by flipping through the print <em>Dictionary</em>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-6\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-1/figure-6.png\" alt=\"Two scatterplot arrays displaying circular data points of varying sizes.

The chart of travelers in the Explorer database. In the chart, every traveler with an entry in the database is represented by a dot. This visualization gives a sense of the volume of the database, showing all travelers at once. The chart interactivity makes it possible to zoom in on any traveler: hovering over a dot reveals the traveler’s name, while clicking on any dot opens up the traveler’s Explorer entry page. 6a shows the dots colored by gender and sized by each entry’s word count, revealing the variety of what is known for each traveler as well as the gender distribution among travelers. 6b shows the dots grouped by gender, more directly revealing the prevalence of male travelers in the database and the paucity of available information about many of the female travelers.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Hovering over an individual dot, readers can see the name of the corresponding traveler and, with a click, can visit the relevant entry. Readers thus can once again thread their way through different travelers’ stories, sorting and browsing in the distinctive manner that makes the Explorer a dynamic and augmented version of the print <em>Dictionary</em>, whose original texts are reproduced alongside the data retrieved from them. This creates a multidimensional reading experience in a more layered structure than, for example, in the online <em>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em>, with a functionality that extends well beyond basic search. The Explorer thus adds to the <em>Dictionary</em> not just by the inclusion of hundreds of additional travelers but also by ensuring that the travelers are perceived relationally and in aggregate. The individual travelers can easily be placed in evolving sets of wider horizons, by sorting and browsing various categories, which provides an expansive view of the world of eighteenth-century travel to Italy.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"a-complex-world-of-data\">A Complex World of Data</h1>\n\n<p>The Explorer’s data, which can be easily downloaded for analytical purposes, allows readers to explore central questions about scale and representation in eighteenth-century travel to Italy and to investigate anew multiple facets of this world. The fully downloaded Explorer data consists of a staggering and complex number of data points about the journeys and lives of travelers in the database. There are close to half a million relating to the travels alone, in a mix of string, Boolean, and numeric data formalized to represent all the information about travelers’ journeys from the <em>Dictionary</em>. This amount is larger than any other open access data set available about eighteenth-century travel. And yet it falls short of what might have been: John Towner’s estimate that tens of thousands traveled puts the 6,007 travelers represented here proper context.<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Despite the massive quantity of information contained in the Explorer, readers who download it should be aware that the data is shot through with absences and uncertainties. What the Grand Tour Explorer presents is the <em>Dictionary</em> with all the richness and the limits of the information it assembled from multiple archives and sources. Many layers are represented in the data, each with its own version of missing information. There are the silences of the original archives—even the records in the “Note dei Forestieri” from the Venice state archives, supposedly recording all comings and goings from the Venetian republic, have their blind spots—not to mention the biases of other sources (letters and journals, for example) that reflect what individual travelers chose to record or simply leave out. The <em>Dictionary</em> does the astounding work of stitching together information from disparate archives to reconstruct these eighteenth-century travels, filling many gaps but also connecting overlapping uncertainties. Within it, one encounters unresolvable conflicts of evidence. For example, it places the future Cambridge professor of modern history <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4664\">John Symonds</a> (1730–1807, travel years 1765–71) in Rome in March 1766, “about to return through Paris to London,” because this is what is stated by Laurence Sterne in a letter from Rome dated March 30, 1766.<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup> The next recorded location for Symonds in the <em>Dictionary</em> is May 1767, when he is said to be arriving in Florence from Bologna. But Symonds’s recently discovered manuscript journals show him in June 1766 touring Sicily together with the Neapolitan doctor and botany professor Domenico Cirillo, having arrived by land through the South of Italy. And in a letter to Linnaeus dated March 1, 1766, Cirillo announced his imminent departure for a trip to Apulia and then to Calabria and Sicily “with a friend.”<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup> Might Symonds have squeezed in a trip to Paris and London in April 1766 before making his way south with Cirillo? We simply do not know.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the irremediable gaps and inconsistencies the <em>Dictionary</em> (and subsequently the Explorer) inherited from its original sources, more were introduced through the selection process involved in assembling the <em>Dictionary</em>, and more complexity still was inserted by the choices made while transforming these printed records into Explorer data. The data itself, however, throws some of these patterns of presence and absence in the recording of historical experiences into sharp relief. This in turn helps readers grasp how the <em>Dictionary</em> represents information about eighteenth-century travel and gives rise to new understandings of the past.</p>\n\n<p>Any engagement with the data requires an understanding of its shape and meaning. The visualization in figure 7 enables consideration of all the travel data at once and represents all locations and years of travel recorded in the database for the Explorer’s 6,007 travelers.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-7\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-1/figure-7.png\" alt=\"World map showing locations of data points.

The Explorer travel data: Palladio map and timeline. The map in the top half shows all places visited by travelers in the Explorer database. The dots are sized to number of visits, indicating visually which were the most frequented places. See in the top-left corner the visual reference key, which shows how dot size is scaled to number of visits. Below is a bar chart timeline, representing all attested years in the database (primarily in the eighteenth century but with some records of travel extending before and beyond), showing how many travelers are recorded in the database as having been in Italy in any given year and colored to represent female travelers (in white), male travelers (in grey), and travelers for whom data is not available (in black). This visualization is created with Palladio.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The spatial data is mapped geographically in the upper band, where every dot represents a location, while the temporal data is shown as a timeline in the lower banner, in which each bar consists of all trips recorded for a given year. In the map view, the dots vary in size to indicate the number of visits to various locations. The largest dots mark the cities of Rome, Venice, Naples, and Florence, which is not surprising: the first three were the largest cities in Italy at the time, and all four were and are well-known tourist destinations. More unexpected are the places that appear as the next-most visited: Padua and Leghorn/Livorno. Padua was an important location, sitting along the way to Venice by land and housing (then as now) both famous art and one of the most ancient and prestigious universities on the European Continent (a destination in its own right). Yet the relative dominance of Padua—overshadowing larger, politically and culturally important cities such as Genoa, Turin, and Milan—owes as much to the source of the data: an archival register from the University in Padua, in which Anglo-Scottish (but also English, Welsh, Scots and Irish) students and visitors were eager to sign their names. Printed in 1921, this register constitutes the second-most-quoted source in the <em>Dictionary</em> and therefore in the Explorer; <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22sources%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Brown%201921%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">641 records</a> are drawn from it. It is also true that this register was well maintained only until 1730, and its use had petered out completely by 1765. Correspondingly, when one considers the presence of Padua in the travel data over time, this city drops significantly among visited places listed in the Explorer after 1730.</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, there are places on the map that must have received many travelers but have been proportionally undercounted. Readers should be aware of the <em>flight map effect</em> of spatial data visualizations, which can distort perceptions of historical data. In the eighteenth century, travelers could not just skip over a place, nor could they necessarily speed through one. Out of the 3,383 travelers recorded in Rome, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22travelPlace%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Rome%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Tuscany%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Liverpool%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Spain%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Hamburg%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Viterbo%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Edinburgh%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Spoleto%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Veneto%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Buonconvento%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Montefortino%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Frascati%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Pistoia%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Massa%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Mantua%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Civitavecchia%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Scotland%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Ancona%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Tivoli%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Piperno%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Italy%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Albano%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Paris%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Pisa%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Siena%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Germany%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22London%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Milan%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Geneva%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Urbino%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Genoa%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Capua%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22England%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Bologna%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Turin%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Leghorn%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Padua%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Venice%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Naples%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Florence%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">698</a> appear to have been <em>only</em> there, but these travelers must have stopped and visited other places on their way to Rome. We can well imagine that places such as Bologna—on one of the main throughways from North to South and a destination in itself—must have had visits from more than the <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22travelPlace%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Bologna%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">671 travelers recorded</a> in the database as having spent time there. Yet this information either went unrecorded in the sources consulted or did not reach the <em>Dictionary</em>, and it was subsequently not added to the Explorer database.</p>\n\n<p>For many of the travelers, the entries gather precious information from disparate sources—ranging from official archives to travelers’ journals or letters to contemporary newsletters—and the result is a fragmentary travel record. For those traveling between Rome and Naples, for example, the passport check was at Capua; an official Neapolitan government document records with precision down to the day (with uncertainty, though, in the spelling of foreign names), when travelers stopped at this checkpoint, a document that was mined extensively to compile the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entries. For <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22travelPlace%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Capua%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Florence%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Venice%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Naples%22%7D,%7B%22negative%22:true,%22_id%22:%22Rome%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">fifty-nine travelers</a> in the database, this is all we have of their Italian journeys, but of course their tours extended beyond Capua.<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup> Even for better-known travelers with well-documented journeys, the travel data remains at times fragmentary. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3324\">Anne Miller</a> (1741–81, travel years 1770–71) documented her 1770–71 tour in regular correspondence that she published in 1776 as <em>Letters from Italy, describing the manners, customs, antiquities, paintings, etc. of that country in the years MDCCLXX and MDCCLXXI, to a friend residing in France</em>. Miller’s entry is indeed one of the longest in the <em>Dictionary</em>, being based on her published account and with additional references to other sources. The format of her published account—organized by letters, each with the date and location of when and where it was written—provides clear and well-structured data. But of the more than thirty places in Italy from which Anne Miller sent letters, only fifteen made it into the <em>Dictionary</em> and thereby into the Explorer. Only by reading the letters in full does one find all the other locations that she recounts having visited.</p>\n\n<p>These observations do not diminish the value of the spatial information collected in the <em>Dictionary</em> and retrieved as data in the Explorer, but they do offer a caveat for how to consider and handle this data. The visualizations, as much as the data on which they are based, represent only what is preserved—surviving through many layers of records, each with its own mix of accidents and intentionality—as opposed to what might have been. Indeed, the map immediately tells readers much about the nature of the data itself and, with some careful examination, about the overall shape of the geography of travel in the eighteenth century.</p>\n\n<p>Similar caveats apply when looking at the temporal dimension of the travel data, represented in full in the timeline in the lower band in figure 7, where each bar totals the number of travelers for that year. This is again made possible by the astounding work the <em>Dictionary</em> does of stitching together information from disparate archives to reconstruct these eighteenth-century travels, filling in many gaps but also connecting overlapping uncertainties. In this timeline visualization, some general patterns appear that are consistent with the consensus among scholars working on the Grand Tour. Over the course of the century, the number of travelers to Italy increases overall, but there are also lulls and spikes, often keyed to wars of this period. Decreases in travel occurred during the War of the Austrian Succession of 1740–48, the Seven Years’ War beginning in 1754, and the American War of Independence from 1775 to 1783. Increases occurred after the peace treaties of 1763 and 1783.</p>\n\n<p>Digital humanities often confirm, by way of hard data, what is already known. This is often also a criticism of its limits. In this case it is quite striking that the overall picture of the Explorer data—formed from thousands of disparate bits and marked by absence and uncertainty—generally matches the ebbs and flows of history’s big events, such as wartime disruptions. This observation mostly tells us about the data and its integrity, but interrogating the data at a granular level—beyond the abstraction of the graph, by looking at the individuals who, in aggregate, constitute the bars in the graph visualization—offers even more insight.</p>\n\n<p>The most pronounced dip in the number of travelers for the second half of the century is the bar for the year 1781, when only thirty-nine travelers in the database are recorded as having arrived in Italy, compared with 127 three years before and ninety-four just a year later. It is tempting to correlate this dip in travel with the fallout of the declaration of American Independence in 1776, when France allied with the United States and entered the war with Great Britain in 1778, joined by Spain the following year, and then the Dutch Republic. The Mediterranean became a war zone where armed merchant ships were granted rights to the cargo of any enemy ship taken as a prize (known as privateering). Indeed, this is the historical context for the story of the already mentioned British ship the <em>Westmorland</em>, which was one such “prize,” captured by a French ship in 1779, its cargo inventoried and put up for sale. The catalog of the <em>Westmorland</em> has survived, and its listing of the ship’s commercial goods along with art, books, and prints sent home by travelers both helped contemporary British travelers pursue their lost items and, more recently, has offered scholars a veritable time capsule revealing what Grand Tour collections were like. This <em>Westmorland</em> story is a concrete moment documenting the relationship between the Grand Tour and contemporary wars. To a degree, the 1781 dip in traveler numbers gleaned from our data does likewise.</p>\n\n<p>What does a closer look at that year’s data offer? For twenty of the thirty-nine travelers reported to have arrived in Italy in 1781 we have some data and more context from the <em>Dictionary</em>. Two of these travelers arrived for their first tour: <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/655\">George Bruce-Brudenell Bruce</a> (1762–83), traveling at the age of nineteen with a tutor by the name of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1691\">Ferguson</a>, and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/963\">Thomas Clarke</a> (b. c. 1742), an older Grand Tourist, traveling extensively after retiring from a military career. Others arrived who had already gone on tours of Italy. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1045\">John Hanger Coleraine</a> (1743–94) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/929\">George James Cholmondeley</a> (1749–1827) did their Grand Tours when they were younger, but in 1781, they were following the magnetic <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/119\">Elizabeth Bridget Armistead</a> (1750–1842) on her first trip to Italy. The sculptor <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1279\">Anne Damer</a> (1748–1828) had first visited in 1779 but returned in 1781 for a second tour, this time accompanied by <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/783\">Lady Campbell</a> (d. 1784). Also, the date on a small portrait of the collector <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2850\">David Digues Latouche</a> (1729–1817), who had traveled before, places him in Rome at this time. A group of painters also arrived in 1781: <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1652\">Robert Fagan</a> (1761–1816), <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2127\">Charles Grignion</a> (1752–1804), <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4001\">Thomas Pye</a> (fl. 1773–97), and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4414\">James Smith</a> (b. c. 1749–after 1797). Fagan and Grignion arrived together; Fagan had returned to London for one year but then came back to Italy for good, while Grignion came as a gold medal winner and also stayed on. Pye and Smith, who might have visited earlier, then lived out their lives in Italy. Other travelers came to visit relatives: Thomas Jenkins, the painter, dealer, and cicerone in Rome, is visited by his nephew <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2678\">James</a>; John Udny, the merchant, collector, and British consul in Venice, is visited by a <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4896\">son</a>; and Horace Mann, the British representative in Florence, is visited by his nephew <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3170\">Horatio</a> (1744-1814), who brought along his young daughter <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3170.2\">Lucy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The mere presence of all these travelers arriving in Italy in 1781 demonstrates that the war did not deter them, whether they were first-time visitors or returnees. Indeed, recent research shows that the French government decided not to discourage British travel during wartime, given the economic benefits to the French economy. Balancing the quantitative and the granular allows one to think through individual choices in the context of larger patterns. One might also discern specific consequences of the war on the Grand Tour. For Horace Mann, in particular, the data allows us to observe that he reduced his usual yearly visits to his uncle to every other year during the Anglo-French war. There is also a singular explicit mention of the war in relation to travelers arriving in 1781, concerning the <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3492\">Hon. Gen James Murray</a> (1719–94), governor of Minorca beginning in 1774, who sailed into Leghorn/Livorno on August 31, 1781; the entry notes that “he evacuated his family during the French siege.” In fact, the text of the <em>Dictionary</em> tells us that Murray brought, along with his pregnant wife <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3492\">Anne Whitham</a> (c. 1761–1824) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3492.2\">daughter</a>, “about twenty other ladies.” Interrogating these absences and presences, and the individual trajectories that lie behind the bar charts, is a process that points beyond the simple use of data visualization for confirming known trends and instead toward new findings and questions.</p>\n\n<p>More insight into the interplay of the quantitative and the qualitative and the meaning of numbers and of missing data comes from considering the counting done by many eighteenth-century travelers themselves. Travel was about observing and describing—using words and measurements for sites and monuments, as well as quotes and references and thick descriptions for customs and events. Tourists also watched and counted other travelers, reporting their numbers in the letters and journals describing their journeys. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/154\">Joseph Atwell</a> (c. 1696–1768, travel years 1729–30), the twenty-four year-old tutor to the twenty-year-old <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1167\">2nd Earl of Cowper</a> (1709–64, travel years 1729–30), reported in a June 1730 letter that there were “no less than 13” English in Florence. In letters to his mother during his first trip to Italy, dated February 1734, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3914\">Richard Pococke</a> (1704–65, years of travel 1733–34, 1737, 1740–41), the future bishop, pioneering mountaineer, and explorer of the East, noted about forty English in Rome. In February 1753, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3596\">Lord North</a> (1732–92, travel years 1752–53), traveling with his stepbrother of the same age (<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1300\">the 2nd Earl of Dartmouth</a>, 1731–1801, travel years 1752–53) along with their tutor <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1985\">Christopher Golding</a> (c. 1710–after 1758, travel years 1752–53), reported, “There are about 40 of our nation in Rome reckoning females.” Diplomats also reported on traveler numbers. The British representative in Florence for almost five decades, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3169\">Horace Mann</a> (1706–86, travel years 1732–33, 1738–86) gave regular updates in his letters to <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4974\">Horace Walpole</a> (1717–97, travel years 1739–41) (after all, the numerous travelers were a major reason for his occupation). Mann noted twelve British travelers on July 21, 1744, thirty-five in August 1751 (“a larger flight of woodcocks than has been seen in many years”), and thirty-seven on October 18, 1768. In December 1772, he noted that over a few weeks’ time, the number of English travelers had dropped from nearly sixty to twenty. In May 1792, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2803\">Lady Philippina Knight</a> (1726–99, travel years 1778–99) wrote from Rome that during the spring, “we have had a hundred and fifty English here.”<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Even these few instances of travelers counting travelers show an increase in how many traveled over the century. One also wonders how these counts align with the numbers in the Explorer. For example, does a search in the Explorer database affirm Atwell’s “no less than 13 English” in Florence in June of 1730? Sixteen, which is the Explorer result of eighteen travelers minus Atwell and the young Earl of Cowper, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22travelPlace%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Florence%22%7D%5D%7D,%22travelDate%22:%7B%22startYear%22:%221730%22,%22endYear%22:%221730%22,%22startMonth%22:%226%22,%22endMonth%22:%226%22%7D%7D\">is a close match</a>. Yet, a closer look at these entries in the Explorer suggests that few if any of these travelers, besides Atwell and his charge, fit the profile of Grand Tourist; rather, many appear to be long-term residents, foreigners who found ways to make a living in Florence. In 1730 <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1055\">John Collins</a> (fl. 1700–1739, travel years c. 1713–39) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1055.1\">Mrs. Collins</a> (travel years c. 1713–39) had been in Florence at that point for about fifteen years, where they ran a hotel “for the Englishman that travels.” <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1365\">Sir Thomas, 4th Baron of Dereham</a> (1679–1739, travel years 1701–39) was brought to Florence as a child and grew up there as a Catholic and Jacobite, attending to Medici interests. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2034\">Daniel Gould</a> (c. 1672–1732, travel years c. 1702–32) also lived in Italy, trying with mixed results for various consular appointments, as did <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4377\">Brinley Skinner</a> (d. 1764, travel years 1724–34), whose father and grandfather had been British merchants in Italy. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4276\">Dennis Scully</a> (c. 1672–1732, travel years c. 1702–32) seems to have been another long-term resident, who appears in sources because of lawsuits and then his renting rooms to travelers. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2721\">William Joy</a> (1675–1734, travel years c. 1702–33))—originally a ship-carpenter from Kent—had been a performing strongman on the London stage who was then hired by the Grand Duke as his own strongman and came to reside in Florence for the next twenty years. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4888\">Thomas Tyrell</a> (d. 1753, travel years 1722–53), originally from Ireland, had been found by the Grand Duke as a child beggar in Prague and brought to Florence, where he became a courtier. The eighteen people counted by the Explorer in Florence in 1730 also includes artists and craftsmen. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3205\">Charles Martin</a> (travel years 1728–52), mentioned by many travelers and in diplomatic correspondence, was living in Florence as a painter and dealer. The two Hugford brothers—<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2563\">Cosimo</a> (fl. 1729–56, travel years 1729–56) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2566\">Ignazio Enrico</a> (1703–78, travel years 1703–78)—were also artists and dealers, whose their entire lives unfolded in Florence, where their father had moved from London to become a watchmaker for the Grand Duke. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3210\">Laetitia Henrietta Martin</a> (d. 1731, travel years 1719–31) had married the Florentine sculptor Alessandro Galileo in England and then moved back to Florence with him. Another British woman in Florence, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4215.1\">Anna St. John</a> (d. 1739, travel years 1728–39), had married the Italian painter <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4215.2\">Giuseppe Grisoni</a> (d. 1769, travel years 1728–69) while he was working in London, and in 1728 they came back to Florence together. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2446\">William Hoare</a> (1707–92, travel years 1728–37), a student of Grisoni’s in London, came with them to spend ten years in Italy. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4215\">Oliver St. Johns</a> (c. 1691–1749, travel years c. 1723–47), Anna’s brother, seems to have moved to Florence even earlier; accounts of him as a disturbed “madman,” who was institutionalized, pepper the correspondence between Horace Mann and Walpole from 1723 to around 1747.</p>\n\n<p>Whom among these sixteen did Atwell count? Reading through the entries, one wonders whether he might not have counted the Irish, the Catholic, the women, the artists, the long-term residents. Behind most clean numbers and clear quantitative measures, counting always requires a decision about categories and dimensions—for Atwell just as for the makers of the <em>Dictionary</em> and, indeed, for our own data assemblage.</p>\n\n<p>Reading through the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entries raises the question of how these sixteen were identified and offers insights into different types of touring. Further reading would offer even more. As for the data alone, a visualization of a single data category or of a single traveler’s data would not enable us to meaningfully distinguish among them, per se, though more comes to the fore when looking at various data dimensions for the travelers in relation to each other and paying attention to what is missing as well as to what is there (see fig. 8). For example, among this group, some occupation data already indicates people who might not count as typical tourists, such as diplomats, an innkeeper, a strongman, and artists.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-8\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-1/figure-8.png\" alt=\"Four charts showing distributions of data across different fields, with each horizontal bar segmented by colors representing gender.\" id=\"fig8\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap8&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap8\">\n\nFig. 8. Tabular view of data types and gaps for the eighteen travelers in Florence in June 1730. These visualizations show the various data types present in the downloaded Explorer data for the eighteen travelers recorded in Florence in June 1730. These are static views from the interactive Breve application. At a glance one sees here gaps in the data and their uneven distribution across the data set. It is apparent, for example, that for all travelers we have name and gender, but for only a few do we have dates of birth and death, parents, or sources. Nor is the amount known about each traveler evenly incremental; for example, we might have sources and parents but not dates of birth.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Close attention to the data, however, leads to rewarding insights. The <em>Dictionary</em>’s entry for Thomas Dereham is among the longest—in the top 5 percent—but while it underlines his role as an influential Jacobite presence and art collector in Italy, it does not mention his lifelong correspondence with the Royal Society on a number of scientific topics. By paying attention to the Explorer’s societies data for Dereham, though, which records his Royal Society fellowship, one is directed to his scientific interests. There are also ways to examine and visualize the data that get one closer to interpretative questions. If, for example, one visualizes the data to show duration of tours, “Atwell” and “Earl of Cowper” emerge quickly as the outliers (see fig. 9). While they are attested in other types of data, they are also the ones who spent the least time in Florence. This shorter time spent sets these two Grand Tourists apart from the long-term resident; everyone else stays much longer, including visiting artists. But, then again, the question arises of “whose Grand Tour?” How do we account for these British travelers who end up staying much longer in Florence? How much a part of the Grand Tour world are they? After all, the innkeeper Collins’s daughter, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/398.1\">Anna Maria Collins</a>, born in Florence, ended up marrying a visiting <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/398\">Grand Tourist</a> and moving back with him to London to participate fully in a post–Grand Tour life.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-9\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-1/figure-9.png\" alt=\"Bar chart showing spans of time spent in Florence by eighteen travelers recorded in June 1730.

Spans of time spent in Florence by the eighteen travelers recorded there in June 1730. This Gantt chart visualization (created with Rawgraph) shows the length of stays in the city for the eighteen travelers attested to be in Florence in June 1730. Colors represent gender. What is shown depends on what the Explorer data records, which might be incomplete, but at a glance, one can already distinguish the typical Grand Tourists (Atwell and Lord Cowper), for whom Florence was a brief stop among other Italian destinations, from the long-term residents and the artists who spent more time in Florence on account of their art training.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Historical data—that “saber-toothed tiger”—is most revealing when approached with a systematic interest in understanding its gaps as well as its interconnectedness. When downloading the Explorer data and separating it from its original context, it is most important to keep in mind its sources and the meaning and character of its original categorization. Only then can one use the data to make new connections and interpretations. The visualization below illustrates this point further (fig. 10). This graph of parallel sets visualizes the whole data set of travelers at a glance in terms of four dimensions: (1) biographical dates—birth, death, either, or neither; (2) origin of the entry—whether the traveler had an entry in the original print <em>Dictionary</em> or had one newly created for the Explorer; (3) occupation and education—that is, data concerning one or the other, both or none of these dimensions; (4) how many visits to places are recorded in the travelers’ data.<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup> This visualization presents only one set of categories and in one particular order, but the principle of interconnectedness and the reality of gaps in the data are the key takeaways.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<!-- <a name=\"figure-10\"> <iframe width=\"620\" height=\"366\" src=\"parallel-sets/index.html\"></iframe> </a> -->\n\n<a name=\"figure-10\"><div id=\"parallel-sets\"></div></a>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n\nimport define from \"../parallel-sets/index.js\";\nimport {Runtime, Library, Inspector} from \"../parallel-sets/runtime.js\";\n\nconst runtime = new Runtime();\nconst main = runtime.module(define, Inspector.into(document.getElementById(\"parallel-sets\")));\n\n</script>\n\n<style>\n    #parallel-sets .observablehq {\n        display: none;\n    }\n    #parallel-sets .observablehq:nth-child(1), #parallel-sets .observablehq:nth-child(2) {\n        display: block;\n    }\n</style>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap10\">\n\nFig. 10. Grand Tour Explorer data: gaps and interconnectedness. This parallel sets visualization focuses on four categories--biographical data, origins of the entries, occupation and education, and number of visits--considered across the whole database of Explorer travelers. It shows the variation in the distribution of these four categories in the data sets, highlighting missing data as well as the significance of intersections among categories to illustrate what data exists for the 6,007 travelers in the database and how to create meaning out of its values. The thickness of each curved line represents a quantity that is repeatedly subdivided by category, while the colors represent gender.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>For example, immediately apparent is which travelers are by and large best documented: men. These are most likely typical elite Grand Tourists, for most of whom we know dates of birth and death, as well as much about their lives (for example, occupation and education), and who have better recorded tours with multiple places visited. But what is also immediately apparent, and perhaps more surprising, is how many of these travelers (as many as two-fifths of the set) are shown in the recorded data to have visited only one place. This surely reflects gaps in the data; however, it is essential to appreciate that, for many, we have additional information in other categories and thus to realize that these travelers have something to tell us about the world of the Grand Tour. Engaging interactively with this visualization reveals, for example, that there are four women for whom the data records both biographical dates and occupation data, but one woman for whom we have only the date of death and occupation data (figs. 11a and 11b). Nevertheless, this woman traveler ranks among the better documented, with between six and twenty-five place visits recorded.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-11\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-1/figure-11.png\" alt=\"Visualization of Grand Tour Explorer data, highlighting four women with both birth and death dates, as well as dedicated entries in the original print Dictionary, and their occupation/education data availability from various sources.

The parallel sets visualization shows that a clear majority of the entries—4,879 out of 6,007—are from the original <em>Dictionary</em>. But 222 are “newly created from headings;” in these cases, entries that pertained to multiple travelers in the <em>Dictionary</em> were turned into individual entries for each traveler, changing the heading to reflect an individual traveler’s name, maintaining the same entry text as in the original <em>Dictionary</em>, and curating the additional data for each by hand. The “newly created from narrative” category—which includes 906 entries—pertains to travelers who were in the <em>Dictionary</em> but subsumed in others’ entries, most often women who appeared under the headings of their husbands. There is more to say about these newly created entries, and the recovery of these hidden figures of the <em>Dictionary</em> is recounted in “Archive to Explorer”—but for now, note how these travelers who appeared only in the background in the <em>Dictionary</em> have become part of the knowable world of the data. Although much less is known about many of these hidden figures—the great majority of them women—this data and the intersecting lines that animate it point us to new questions and tell us new stories.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"doing-research-with-the-explorer-seven-scholars-essays\">Doing Research with the Explorer: Seven Scholars’ Essays</h1>\n\n<p><em>A World Made by Travel</em> shares Grand Tour data publicly, thus opening new research possibilities to all. At the same time, it features several original studies conducted using the Explorer and its database. This scholarship was produced by researchers who specialize in areas related to the Grand Tour (“domain experts,” to use data science parlance) while the Explorer was being created. A number of scholars of eighteenth-century British travel to Italy accepted invitations to participate in two workshops held in 2016 and 2017. At these convenings, participants generously worked through research questions of their own while using the Explorer. Some were already familiar with digital humanities work; for others this was their first experimentation with digital history and with the idea of working with data. All brought an intensive knowledge of archives and of the historical world of the Grand Tour. The conversations during these workshops informed the final shape of the Explorer and provided an opportunity to showcase how data work and data visualization can support original scholarship.</p>\n\n<p>The essays included here demonstrate powerfully the varieties of new research made possible by the Grand Tour Explorer. Open access to the Explorer—both to the abilities to browse, search, and sort and to the underlying database itself—will in time produce more and unexpected scholarly work, yet some features of what such research may look like are already apparent. The intensity of engagement with the data fluctuates; some scholars rely on word searching, for example, and some research questions are addressed through only a subset of the 6,007 travelers. All studies show the importance of contextualizing the work done with the Explorer’s data through further research and careful engagement with primary sources and the secondary literature. The newly populated world of travelers made accessible by the Explorer, which renders equally observable and searchable both elite and nonelite travelers, and which includes underdocumented as well as previously hidden figures, has encouraged research about travelers who were less visible before this digital transformation. The scholars’ essays in <em>A World Made by Travel</em>—alongside the study of sixty-nine architects in the Explorer that my team and I published in 2017 in the <em>American Historical Review</em><sup id=\"fnref:40\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></sup>—are the first to use the Explorer. Taken together, these essays show scholars using the Explorer effectively to look for unexplored facets of the world of the Grand Tour—seeking the Italians, for example, or focusing on specific types of (nonelite) travel or traveler or on specific activities and interactions. In some cases, scholars have done so by looking at large numbers, in others by focusing on smaller sets, but all exemplify deep historical work achieved by engaging with the Explorer’s data, in combination with attention to context and sources beyond its bounds, to collectively rejuvenate the study of eighteenth-century travel to Italy.</p>\n\n<p>Rosemary Sweet’s “<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled\">Who Traveled, Where and When? Using the Grand Tour Explorer to Examine Patterns of Travels and Travelers</a>,” extends Sweet’s distinct interest in urban centers and tourists’ experiences to consider cities beyond the top five that her previous work illuminated, using Explorer data on travel to Turin, Milan, Genoa, Leghorn/Livorno, and Bologna.<sup id=\"fnref:41\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></sup> Building on the travel data for these cities, Sweet probes patterns of representation in the Explorer’s data, integrating these findings with her knowledge of eighteenth-century travel accounts, both published and in manuscript.

Despite data limitations, Midura models sophisticated data analysis tying relations between infrastructure growth and travel patterns to historical developments. She also points to further questions about travel and gender, and family and groups versus individuals.<sup id=\"fnref:42\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Melissa Calaresu’s research has long focused on recovering and understanding the Italian (and particularly the Neapolitan) presence in the European Enlightenment.<sup id=\"fnref:43\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></sup> In “<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/calaresu-life-and-death\">Life and Death in Naples: Thomas Jones and Urban Experience in the Grand Tour (Explorer)</a>,” Calaresu focuses on the painter Thomas Jones’s relationship with Italy’s people and with their urban and domestic lives, finding in the Explorer traces of engagement beyond the touristic mode and seeking the occluded presence of Italians. Calaresu uses the length of time spent traveling as a significant measure of travelers’ engagement with a place and thus rewrites travel patterns and their assumed meaning.</p>\n\n<p>In her essay “<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/paul-ciceroni-and-their-clients\">Ciceroni and Their Clients</a>,” Carole Paul, a scholar interested in the relationship between people and the art they experience in museums or public spaces, examines another understudied figure in the world of the Grand Tour, that of the <em>ciceroni</em> who guided tourists around sites and educated them about these places’ history and art.<sup id=\"fnref:44\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></sup> With the help of the Explorer’s various tools, Paul finds fifteen ciceroni, twelve of whom have their own entries in the Explorer, and she identifies 142 of their clients among the Explorer’s travelers. While acknowledging that there were many more clients, and also more ciceroni, Paul’s systematic examination of the data for the group she has identified nonetheless leads to a fuller sense of the careers of the ciceroni and of the types of clients who employed them.</p>\n\n<p>Sophus Reinert, an economic historian who considers travel in the context of emergent capitalism and international competition, went looking in the Explorer for “the economic Grand Tour.”<sup id=\"fnref:45\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></sup> “<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/reinert-economic-grand-tour\">Mapping the Economic Grand Tour: Travel and Emulation in Enlightenment Europe</a>” is the result of his search for travelers whose journeys attest to economic interests, ranging from merchants to early economic thinkers. Reinert finds evidence of distinct patterns in the data for these Grand Tourists, while making the case for why these types of travelers help us to understand more fully eighteenth-century travel to Italy.</p>\n\n<p>Catherine Sama, in “<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/sama-rosalba-carriera\">Going Digital: Re-searching Connections between Rosalba Carriera and British Grand Tourists</a>,” also explores the Italian-British divide, drawing on her expertise on women in early modern Venice.<sup id=\"fnref:46\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></sup> Sama focuses on Rosalba Carriera, who as an Italian artist did not receive an entry in the <em>Dictionary</em>. Using mentioned names and their networks, Sama reconstructs a full set of relations to better understand Carriera’s life and work, including discovering new sources describing her studio in Venice.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in “<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/macdonald-harlequin-horsemanship\">Harlequin Horsemanship: Non–Grand Tourists on the Grand Tour (Explorer)</a>,” Simon Macdonald, an expert on transnational history, and particularly on British people living abroad in early modern Europe, builds on his discovery in the archives of one British equestrian showman in Italy by using the Explorer to look for more.<sup id=\"fnref:47\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></sup> The resulting data set enables MacDonald to construct an unprecented historical narrative of British equestrian shows in Italy, while also reflecting on the archival possibilities and limitations built into the Explorer itself.</p>\n\n<p>Cumulatively, these essays propel the study of the Grand Tour forward. They also demonstrate some of the most significant benefits of the transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em> into the Explorer (along with foregrounding the <em>Dictionary</em>’s hidden figures) to be not so much the <em>total mass</em> of data it makes available as much as the Explorer data’s <em>density</em> of information, the systematic nature of the categories that organize its information, and the clarity about its boundaries and limits as an information data set. In the Explorer, researchers can see, as if for the first time, what has remained stubbornly uncertain about the Grand Tour. Crisscrossing between data sets facilitates original questions and innovative interpretations, even as knowledge of the sources, archives, and <em>context</em>—that sticky historiographical concept—remain the key to approaching this information.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"a-world-made-by-travel-and-digital-history\"><em>A World Made by Travel</em> and Digital History</h1>\n\n<p>Together with colleagues in the Mapping the Republic of Letters Project at Stanford University (the umbrella project from which the origins of <em>A World Made by Travel</em> emerged), I first wrote about the possibilities and challenges of doing historical research in the digital age in 2017. We reflected on working with historical sources as data in a time of rapid digitization and “datafication” and about working with printed and some archival material that was becoming available online as jpegs, pdfs, html texts, and metadata shared by repositories. Also under discussion was the multifaceted richness of early modern historical data, traversing time and space and connecting people, and how this richness coexisted with the inherently incomplete nature of this type of data. We stood by our dedication to the interplay between the quantitative and qualitative as essential, and we hoped to refine the concept of “big data” such that it would take into account interconnectedness rather than merely size and number. We discussed our filtering, plotting, measuring, parsing, and visualizing of information as data and our own experience of stepping back and observing this data’s contours—how this prompted us to take a closer look at underlying patterns and forgotten figures while remaining aware of that data’s fragmentary character. In the air was a possible future in which scholars could seamlessly share and analyze one another’s findings, using linked data to identify overlaps with existing data sets and to interact with new ones.<sup id=\"fnref:48\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:48\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Now, just a few years later and on the other side of the social and technological ruptures entailed by a global pandemic and the spectacular rise of AI, the concept of data is at the forefront of essential conversations more than ever, both in the academy and beyond. Three major journals in their respective humanities fields (<em>History and Theory</em>, <em>Critical Inquiry</em>, and <em>New Literary History</em>) published special issues about data in 2022 and 2023, just as the publication of <em>A World Made by Travel</em> was under way.<sup id=\"fnref:49\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:49\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></sup> From megabyte to zettabyte, the exponential growth of data represents a new structural condition, and the constructed nature of data is at the core of reflections about history in the digital age. Drawing a contrast with earlier forms of cliometrics, Claire Lemercier and Claire Zalc, for example, call themselves “alternative quantifiers” and emphasize the messiness of data, pointing to the interrogation of assemblages’ layers not only for what is missing but also for how they overlap, and how outliers can reveal specific forms of interaction among categories.<sup id=\"fnref:50\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:50\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">50</a></sup> The ongoing growth of data as both an object of discourse and an epistemology in its own right, a way to think, poses these questions more urgently than in 2017. Indeed, it is increasingly crucial to highlight counting as a historiographical <em>act</em>—not merely a passive means of registering information but a way (for better or for worse) to actively establish categories and produce knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>The work that <em>A World Made by Travel</em> makes public has been an ongoing experiment in this effort. The Explorer was not “born digital,” nor does it use a given set of metadata or create data from scratch. At its core is a published prosopographical text, which is itself structured information. My team and I began by mining this text, but this work soon turned into something much larger, as the print <em>Dictionary</em> began to take shape as a dynamic resource. This was a result of processes digitization and datafication, involving a number of computational techniques, as well as of formalization, categorization, and interpretation performed iteratively and, to a large extent, collaboratively. Does the <em>Dictionary</em>’s structured information constitute “big data”? It may contain a larger set of travelers than have ever been studied at once before, but it falls far short of the size of any contemporary big-data sets and also of the estimates for travel at the time. The value of the Explorer data resides in its density rather than its absolute size, and in its multidimensional, humanistic, and carefully curated nature. Its primary rewards, as with much rich historical data, are the patterns that it reveals and the new questions that it prompts.</p>\n\n<p>The 6,007 travelers of the Explorer, and the work of analysis and interpretation already done on them, take their place in these contemporary debates. Intriguingly, most sophisticated criticism of foundational publications in digital humanities now comes from digital humanists themselves, rather than from so-called critics of the digital humanities.<sup id=\"fnref:51\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:51\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></sup> What today seems to have been a nearly unfettered enthusiasm for macroanalysis and big data in earlier publications, a striving after objectivity, has given ground to data-intensive humanities projects that are historically situated and dedicated to the complexities of interpretation. A desire for the total corpus (always posited as happening in the future) has been replaced by calls for the careful curation of data, for a recognition of the essential value of data editing (rather than quick dismissals of data cleaning), and for transparency in the documentation of data-set construction, and in practices of visualization and interpretation. In many ways, this emphasis on edition and curation goes a long way toward negotiating what is now seen as too simplistic an opposition between close and distant reading.<sup id=\"fnref:52\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><em>A World Made by Travel</em> aligns with this evolution. From the start, work on the Grand Tour Explorer was essentially concerned with problems of data-set construction and committed to transparency about the transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s information and sources into data. The digital categorizations adapted from the <em>Dictionary</em> required explanation, as did the many additional categories created for the Explorer, all of which are documented in <em>A World Made by Travel</em>. The idea of sharing data is inherent in the original print <em>Dictionary</em> as a reference work, and the Explorer carries this tradition out in digital form.</p>\n\n<p>Yet while the bibliography in this field has developed quickly, in line with the accelerating pace of technology, it may be helpful to reach back a few decades to consider the place of digital history in the ebbs and flows of historiography. In 1991, Robert Rowland, in an essay entitled “L’informatica e il mestiere dello storico” (Computer science and the historian’s craft) for the special issue “Informatica e fonti storiche” (Computer science and historical sources), presented the computer as a solution to the disciplinary impasse between quantitative and qualitative history. He was thinking of “nominal record linkage” for its ability to connect all sources relevant to the same individual and thus to reconstruct relationships between people and groups.<sup id=\"fnref:53\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:53\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></sup> In the process, Rowland imagined a near future in which such a database could be processed at speed and shared easily among scholars. The coming and going of the minidisk (which seemed futuristic to Rowland) and the advent of the cloud have provided new means for rapidly processing and sharing large amounts of data, at rates unimaginable in 1991. But the bridging of the micro and the macro and of the local and the global—central issues for any discussion concerned with the relation between the quantitative and the qualitative in historical research—remains a work in progress in historiography at large, and the ability to link data has yet to be refined.<sup id=\"fnref:54\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:54\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">54</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>There is no denying that, as the digital has become part of so many scholars’ work (even beyond the realm of self-described digital humanists), it has changed much about historical research. Emma Rothschild has recently shared a poignant account of doing historical research in our digital age. In her 2021 <em>An Infinite History</em>, Rothschild produces a multiscale history by following up on the eighty-three signatures opposed to a 1764 prenuptial document in the provincial town of Angoulême. Rothschild expands this initial group of signatories into a network of four thousand individuals, whose lives allow her to move the story forward through decades and centuries as a record of deep social and economic change—the making of historical time. When she describes her research, moving from the archives to online searching, adding information bit by bit in the course of reconstructing the lives of thousands of individuals “glimpsed out of the corner of the eye, or at the edge of the screen,” she underlines the importance of online research possibilities, while speaking honestly about the solitude of such work. She also recalls how these very possibilities raised questions—about the scale of what is left undigitized, for instance, and the biases that defined this division, and the biases of the search algorithms themselves.<sup id=\"fnref:55\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:55\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">55</a></sup> Lara Putnam, in her 2016 <em>AHR</em> article “The Transnational and the Text-Searchable,” explored some of these biases as well. Putnam describes the digital age’s new shadows, which exclude those (especially from the Global South) whose histories had not been digitized and likely never would be. These kinds of questions—about how we do this work now as scholars, or about worldwide inequities in archival preservation, or about the shifting historical concept of context as a solution to the opposition between the large-scale and the granular—are all relevant to the prosopographical database of the Explorer.</p>\n\n<p><em>A World Made by Travel</em>’s foregrounding of unrepresented individuals brings such hidden figures out of the shadows and back from the edge of the screen. By poring over missing data and inconsistencies in the original print <em>Dictionary</em>, by working to reconcile the presence of obscure names and identities, by going beyond the most famous and recognizable Grand Tourists whose stories have been told again and again, the project takes up the words of Virginia Woolf in her 1939 essay “The Art of Biography”: “The question now inevitably asks itself, whether the lives of great men only should be recorded. Is not anyone who has lived a life, and left a record of that life, worthy of biography—the failures as well as the successes, the humble as well as the illustrious? And what is greatness? And what smallness?”<sup id=\"fnref:56\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:56\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">56</a></sup> Woolf’s words are particularly resonant because one can perceive them in relation to contemporary debates on the first <em>Dictionary of National Biography</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:57\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:57\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">57</a></sup> Leslie Stephen, Woolf’s father, had raised such questions as editor of the <em>Dictionary of National Biography</em> when he observed that it would be “the timid and third-rate” people,” “the less conspicuous people about whom it is hard to get information elsewhere,” who would “prove the real test of the value of the book”— lives, as he later specified, that needed “to be reconstructed from obituary notices, or from references in memoirs and collections of letters.”<sup id=\"fnref:58\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:58\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">58</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Likewise, one of the tests of our project’s value has been our historical research on “the less conspicuous people” who populate its many digital pages, and how their presence transforms our perception of the world of the Grand Tour.<sup id=\"fnref:59\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:59\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">59</a></sup> Turning once again to our British travelers in Florence in June of 1730, only four out of those are in the new digital <em>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em>. William Joy, the strongman known as “The English Sampson,” is one of these, along with three artists: the two Hugford brothers, who are combined into a single entry, and the portrait painter William Hoare. Even for William Joy and William Hoare, though, there is no information about the time they spent in Italy—a divide of national historiographical traditions, alongside that between South and North, persisting in the more connected digital age.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, the <em>ODNB</em> covers twenty thousand lives from the eighteenth century, which makes the 6,007 travelers documented in the Explorer a good number for comparison. Proportionally, the Explorer has many more women and travelers employed in the service of others, but it also contains relatively little information about them. Linked data, as envisioned with colleagues from the Mapping the Republic of Letters project, retains the promise of making these comparisons across databases possible, which was mere wishful thinking in 1991, when the processing and transferring of data was a fraction of what is possible today. But this process will remain hard work for the foreseeable future. Jason Kelly offered the insightful suggestion, for example, of cross-referencing the database of the Explorer with the database created by the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slavery to bring the world of British travel into illuminating dialogue with the imperial economy of slavery, which was a major engine in the economy of travel to Italy.<sup id=\"fnref:60\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:60\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">60</a></sup> Again, there is nothing yet automatic about such a process, but it entails far more than just cross-checking names, requiring time to reconcile names and people across generations. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/0\">Charles Abbot</a>, for example, had definite ties to the plantation economy, but these ties would never be made apparent by computational checking of names alone across the two databases; linked data and total unique identifiers are yet to materialize as hoped for since the early 1990s at least.</p>\n\n<p>One approach that is emerging from digital history is that of collective biography, which, in aggregate and with archival digitization, encompasses far more figures than previously known. Ruth Anhert, for example, is mining the data set that she curated out of state papers, specifically Tudor correspondences, with more than twenty thousand identified individuals, to reconstruct a collective biography of the middlemen of the Tudors’ intelligence service, most of whom have not previously entered historiographical narratives.<sup id=\"fnref:61\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:61\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">61</a></sup> There are new possibilities at play here. The prosopography of the Explorer, like that of the <em>ODNB</em>, is not exhaustive, but unlike the <em>ODNB</em>, the Explorer’s choice of who to remember is not based on perceived significance, but solely on the fact of having traveled in Italy and left behind a trace in one of the sources examined by the <em>Dictionary</em>’s team. Even in smaller sets and aggregates, such as the sixty-nine architects considered in the first case study published with Explorer data, this realizes a powerful promise of collective biography. In counting—as, for example, in the case of the sixty-nine architects—those who succeeded and those who did not, those who died in Italy and those who moved elsewhere, those who went willingly and those who went under some form of duress, the Explorer gets us closer not only to the history of who has been deemed worthy of remembrance but to the fuller potentiality of the past. Sabina Loriga has advocated for collective biography as a historiographical space where “what matters is variety,” since “only a multitude of experiences” enable “consideration [of] two fundamental dimensions of history, that is conflicts and potentiality.”<sup id=\"fnref:62\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:62\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">62</a></sup> The aggregates of the Explorer’s travelers—the interconnecting of various biographical and travel dimensions, even of those for whom little information is known—might just allow us to tell a more inclusive story of the Grand Tour, with new scope and meanings.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"a-classical-coda\">A Classical Coda</h1>\n\n<p>A decade after <em>The Tribuna of the Uffizi</em>, a canvas simultaneously so crowded and so empty, Johan Joseph Zoffany painted the British collector Charles Townley, surrounded by his favorite items and in conversation with friends (fig. 12). Another group portrait in conversational style, this famous painting once again shows elite British men among classical antiquities, this time transplanted onto British soil. Townley was indeed then amassing what would become one of the largest collections in Britain. All the pieces in the painting are accurately depicted and easily recognizable but for the fact that Zoffany has imaginatively assembled them so as to crowd the library. (At the time, they were actually housed in downstairs rooms, with ample space for Townley to invite public viewings.) This intimate library scene has become a favorite image to represent the passion for antiquity that animated eighteenth-century British culture. Viccy Coltman, though, has recently dug deeper into this picture of striking contrast between the colorfully dressed elite males and the pale and lucent stone objects and naked marble statues among and around them. Putting Zoffany’s picture in relation to a similar scene that the painter Richard Cosway captured several years earlier in <em>Charles Townley with a Group of Connoisseurs, “Lecture on Venus’s Arse</em>” (fig. 13), as well as to contemporary correspondences that she had uncovered, Coltman highlights the homosocial and erotic tensions underlying both scenes, connecting the library scene and the lewder lecture on Venus’s arse under the rubric “sex and the antique.”<sup id=\"fnref:63\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:63\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">63</a></sup> Yet again, we have a crowded scene in which much is missing, from the women, to the various intermediaries, to those able to transport the works from Italy back to England. Such is the story of how a lot of ancient art came into classical studies.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-12\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-1/figure-12.png\" alt=\"Interior scene of a sculptor's studio with four gentlemen surrounded by nude and clothed Classical marble statues, plaster casts, and busts.

These objects, along with eight thousand others in Townley’s collection, eventually made their way to the British Museum, an acquisition four times as large as that of famous vases and other antiquities from Sir William Hamilton.</p>\n\n<p>Piranesi himself was originally from Venice. He moved to Rome precisely because it was the favored destination for artists from all over Europe, on account of its art and ancient remains, and the crowds of tourists—and possible patrons—that it attracted. Here he became one of the most influential visual interpreters of Italy’s antiquity, shaping its imagination and study in ways that reverberate still today.<sup id=\"fnref:64\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:64\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">64</a></sup> His engravings, highly sought after by Grand Tourists for their visionary character, continue to raise questions of scale and representation that go to the heart of the Grand Tour and of Classics as a discipline. As a recent Morgan Library exhibition has shown, Piranesi chose to insert into these engravings real people that he observed and drew himself, whether they were workers in his printshop or people he encountered on the street.<sup id=\"fnref:65\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:65\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">65</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>One place that Piranesi returned to again and again was Cestius’s Pyramid in Rome, where he used the human figure both to measure the physical scale of the monument and to suggest, metaphorically, the immense scale of history (fig. 14).<sup id=\"fnref:66\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:66\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">66</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-14\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-1/figure-14.png\" alt=\"Four 18th-century etchings by Piranesi depicting the Pyramid of Cestius in Rome from various angles, showcasing the ancient monument surrounded by walls, ruins, and vegetation in a picturesque style.\" id=\"fig14\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap14&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap14\">\n\nFig. 14.

Hailed for beautifully arresting and haunting works such as <em>The Kitchen Table</em> series, the <em>Louisiana Project</em>, and the recent retrospective entitled <em>Witness</em>—all of which turn an explicitly Black gaze on the fraught history of race in the US—Weems created her series <em>Roaming</em> by photographing various Italian sites from Rome as far south as Matera (fig. 15). Always in black and white, her images invariably include in the frame the solitary figure of a Black woman as seen from behind in a long black dress.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-15\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-1/figure-15.png\" alt=\"A black-and-white photographic portrayal of the same subject as previous images but in the foreground of this Pyramid scene stands a human figure in black, small in contrast to the looming architecture.\" id=\"fig15\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap15&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap15\">\n\nFig. 15.

She’s an alter-ego. My alter-ego, yes . . . this woman can stand in for me and for you; . . . she leads you into history.

Weems’s muse can also serve as a guide for rescaling the history of classical travel, inspiring the recovery of previously obscured or forgotten figures within that history. At a moment when many would like for the humanities and the discipline of Classics to expand their range and to become more inclusive, digital tools that allow us to glimpse the many thousands of people, humble as well as illustrious, who roamed among Italy’s antiquities—if used thoughtfully and with an allowance for absence and uncertainty—might be one way forward.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"notes\">Notes</h1>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>For the most detailed recent study of this painting that supports these identifications, see Margery Morgan, “British Connoisseurs in Rome: Was It Painted by Katherine Read?” <em>British Art Journal</em> 7, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006): 40–44; since, note the poignant contextualization for this painting in Mark Hallett, “2.

This wonderful digital publication renders the <em>Dictionary</em> word-searchable but otherwise repeats, in digital form, the text of the print edition (and also misses a number of entries—another example of the vagaries of digitization with which we have become all too familiar during our own project). And more recently the <em>Dictionary</em> has become digitally available and searchable in the HathiTrust Digital Library. A noteworthy feature of the Adam Matthew Grand Tour is the access it provides to beautiful digital reproductions of a number of Grand Tour archival documents. Reviews at the time of its first publication in 2009 (for example Katy Layton-Jones, review of The Grand Tour, <em>Reviews in History</em>, https://reviews.history.ac.uk/review/839) did not mention the <em>Dictionary</em>. Also, while the Explorer is open access, the Adam Matthew Grand Tour is for-profit and affordable only for well-funded libraries; the <em>ODNB</em> is accessible freely only in part, but anyone with a library card can access it, and it has been a major part of the conversation about prosopography for more than a hundred years, culminating at the current digital age. <a href=\"#fnref:31\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li id=\"fn:32\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>For a good overview, see Philip Carter, “What Is National Biography For?

        "content"  : "<p>My interest in the Grand Tour explorer arises out of my own work on the engagement of British travelers with Italian cities during the long eighteenth century. Some years ago, I published a book that concentrated upon British experiences and representations of Italian cities during the long eighteenth century, Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c. 1690-1820.1 As an urban historian, I was less concerned with what was collected or purchased by travelers, or with their social networks, than with exploring how images of major Italian cities were constructed and considering their influence in British culture. Given the opportunity to work with the Grand Tour Explorer, I wanted to use it to pursue several questions.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Like many historians, years of immersion in the primary sources meant that I had an intuitive sense of evolving patterns of travel and the composition of the traveling body. However, I was unable to provide any rigorous quantifiable basis for my conclusions or generalizations. How far were my generalizations borne out by the evidence of the Explorer, while taking into account the complex nature of its data, which we know to be far from complete (see the introduction of the book)? What new light could the Explorer cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the Explorer tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body? The dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste, acquired and polished in Italy, exercised such a powerful influence upon Britain’s eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.2 But it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic grand tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out throughout my book was the increasing presence of both female travelers and travelers from beyond the landed elite over the course of the eighteenth century, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book: Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile: such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa and Leghorn.</p>\n"

It is complete for 2,439 travelers, meaning that the year of birth is known and recorded in the database for less than half (around 40.6 percent). For around a quarter of these, the years of birth are qualified by word markers that indicate some measure of uncertainty or approximation, such as <em>circa</em>, <em>by</em>, or <em>after</em>. These markers are string data. In the Explorer, the markers are visible, displayed next to the year of birth in the left column of travelers’ individual entries.

For eighty-two of these, the death year is qualified by word markers indicating some measure of uncertainty or approximation, such as <em>circa</em>, <em>by</em>, or <em>after</em>. These qualifying markers are string data. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#death-date\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Death place.</strong> This is the placename of the geographical location where a traveler died; the data ranges in specificity from a town name to a country name. This is string data, appearing as a search field on the Explorer page, as well as in words in both the Explorer display and the downloaded tabular format. Places of death are sparsely known and recorded in the database; there are only seventy-one unique locations, accounting for 320 travelers’ deaths. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#death-place\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>DBITI</em> Employments &amp; Identifiers.</strong> These are the terms in the <em>Dictionary</em> that describe travelers’ endeavors, achievements, interests, and defining characteristics. They are listed after the traveler’s name and any recorded biographical dates but before any further biographical information. Around one-sixth of the travelers in the Explorer have these brief descriptors; 914 travelers share 212 terms, and many have two, three, or even four such identifiers. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-41\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Education.</strong> The database contains education information for 1,202 travelers—that is, around one-fifth of the total travelers (just over 20% percent). In most cases, it indicates primary and secondary schools, colleges, universities, or other specialized institutions (whether religious, legal, or artistic). At times, it includes degrees obtained and attendance dates. There are also cases of travelers studying under specific teachers or apprenticing with specific experts—most often, this is the case for artists and architects. In some cases, only the education location—given as the city or country—is recorded. This education data is structured around the categories of “Institution” (there are 107 institutions for 1,639 records), “Place” (there are sixty-nine places for 1,734 records), “Degree” (there are twelve types of degrees for 146 records), “Teacher” (there are ninety-six teachers for 123 records). <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#education\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entry ID.</strong> This is a numeric data point expressing the unique identifier assigned to each traveler entry and connecting all data pertaining to it. This entry ID remains constant throughout the database and its exported file formats. The entry ID allows one to confidently move across different fields, filters, and data categories in the Explorer or manipulate data from downloaded tabular files without losing track of which travelers are being considered. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#entry-id\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exhibitions &amp; Awards.</strong> These are records for the art exhibitions in which travelers displayed their work, as well as any prizes and educational fellowships they were awarded. There are 419 records for 147 travelers in the database. The data consists of the institution names that hosted the exhibitions and granted the prizes and fellowships, as well as any specific awards received and the relevant dates as available. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-65\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gender.</strong> This is string data for a category that tags each entry as <em>female</em>, <em>male</em>, or <em>data not available</em>. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#gender\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marriage.</strong> The database contains marriage information for around one-third of the travelers. This data consists of spouse names, marriage year, and (when a traveler remarried) a sequence number. Within this clearly defined tripartite structure, there is much variation. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#marriage\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mentioned names.</strong> These are the records of people mentioned in others’ entries. More than four-fifths of the traveler entries have at least one mentioned name. There are 24,234 records for mentioned names, totaling 6,502 unique names. Out of these mentioned names, 4,323 belong to other travelers with an Explorer entry ID and account for 19,053 records. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#mentioned-names\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Military careers.</strong> This category lists the ranks for travelers who served in the military, with 723 records across 265 travelers in the database. This large discrepancy hints at how many travelers with military careers—more than two-thirds of them—held multiple posts as they rose in army or naval rank. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#military-careers\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Occupations &amp; Posts.</strong> This data represents traveler occupations and posts as listed in the <em>Dictionary</em>; these range from political appointments and honors to trades and crafts. The Explorer data records around 256 such positions and professions for about 25 percent of travelers in the database (1,522 of them). Often the records of these occupations and posts are accompanied by additional information, such as dates or places. Sometimes this additional information consists of details like the names of people for whom travelers worked or titles of books they wrote. Among the myriad biographical data in the Explorer database, this is one of the most varied and rich datasets. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-47\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Occupations &amp; Posts: Group.</strong> These are the eleven groupings that gather thematically related occupations and posts for easier interrogation of the data. This is the list of these groups, starting with the most populated in descending order. Click on each to read more about it: <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-48\">statesmen and political appointees</a> (887 travelers); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-49\">army and navy</a> (301 travelers); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-50\">diplomacy</a> (203 travelers); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-51\">scholars, academics, authors</a> (178); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-52\">clergy</a> (154); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-53\">artists, architects, craftsmen</a> (77); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-54\">law</a> (49); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-55\">domestic service</a> (46); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-56\">finance and trade</a> (37); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-57\">patrons and founders</a> (31); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-58\">physicians</a> (28).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Origin.</strong> This string data point explains the origin of each digital entry, with three options: “From the <em>Dictionary</em>” indicates entries reproduced as they appear in the print <em>Dictionary</em>; “Extracted from heading” means entries newly created by dividing an entry whose heading in the print <em>Dictionary</em> includes multiple travelers; and “Extracted from narrative” means entries newly created by retrieval from the narrative of another traveler’s entry—that is, “hidden figures.” <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#entry-origin\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Parents.</strong> This data gives the names of the parents of travelers when recorded in the database. There are 3,110 records for 2,462 travelers, meaning that for 648 travelers, both parents are recorded. For almost a third of these records (1,151) there is an Entry ID, meaning that the parents are also travelers in the database. In some cases, the data includes additional information, such as order of birth (for 1,323 records, expressed as a numeric value or an abbreviation for older, elder, younger, or youngest), or the notations of “surviving” (228), “heir” (54), “illegitimate” (25), and “posthumous” (3). <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#parents\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Societies &amp; Academies.</strong> This string data represents the cultural, scientific, and artistic associations for which there are records of affiliation in the database. There are twenty-four societies and academies, for which we have 695 records of affiliations relating to 501 travelers (around 8.3% of the total). The records also include the role played by travelers in these associations and for many of these also a temporal dimension, whether expressed as a single year or a range of years. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#paragraph-62\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sources.</strong> These are the records for sources referenced in the entries, consisting of published and archival material titles, that appear in the <em>Dictionary</em>’s footnotes and extensive bibliography. There are 545 sources, and a majority of entries (sixty-nine percent) reference at least one, across 11,164 records. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#sources\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Travel date.</strong> These are the records, a mix of numeric and string data, of the time spent by travelers in each visited place. Records are organized around arrival and departure dates. Each one is designed to contain a day, month, and year of both arrival and departure; but in many instances one or more of these data points are left empty or qualified with “markers.” Uncertainty and missing data are features of this category. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#travel-date\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>—tours.</strong> A tour constitutes the combined records of locations and dates that represent a traveler’s journey to Italy. The tour data consists of a tourIndex and tour dates. The tourIndex is a numeric value assigned to each tour a traveler has taken in chronological order, starting with “1” and increasing sequentially. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/presenting-the-data#tours\">Read more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>—visits.</strong> These are the various individual records of stops constituting a tour, each record centering on a place and time of visit.

        "content"  : "<h1 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>From its origin in Stanford University’s Mapping the Republic of Letters Project in 2008, I sought to involve both undergraduate and graduate students in the collaborative work of the Grand Tour Project. The project got its initial data boost when Stanford graduate students Sarah Murray and Molly Taylor-Poleskey worked on the first manual data retrieval from <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy, 1701–1800</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells;<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> they remained involved in the project even after they embarked on academic careers elsewhere, carrying digital humanities expertise with them. Only a year into Mapping the Republic of Letters, the students in Jeff Heer’s CS448b Data Visualization class at Stanford produced an award-winning interactive visualization tool based on the project’s data, one of the first steps in the visualization path that led to the development of <a href=\"http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/about/\">Palladio</a>.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> In the summer of 2010, Mapping the Republic of Letters was working with Kofi Ohene-Adu, then an undergraduate student in computer science, to make sense of the Grand Tour data in particular. Such relationships were essential to our transdisciplinary and transgenerational collaborations, and the founding in 2012 of the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) meant that student participation could be formalized through the Center’s undergraduate research program. Many undergraduates have since interned with me on the project—three worked as developers well beyond their time at Stanford—and still more graduates have been <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/acknowledgements-and-credits\">critical collaborators</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But I also worked to bring the Grand Tour Project into the classroom, teaching courses based in my home department of Classics and cross-listed with many others (including History, English, and Modern Languages and Cultures). Such is the transdisciplinary nature of Grand Tour studies. This teaching experience and related materials—much of it developed together with graduate students and assistants—is shared here in the hope that it will be of use to or inspire others in their own teaching. Courses in digital humanities are now established in many humanities curricula, while data science programs are emerging and expanding the reach of what statistics classes used to be. All these programs promote data literacy as a necessary skill for students today—with attendant concerns about which data sets to use in the classroom, whether or how much computer programming should be included, how to promote project- and collaboration-based teaching, how to use open-access resources, how to include ethics and the humanities in the fundamentals of data work, and how to teach visualization as part of the interpretation of data.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> In this evolving context, my graduate TAs and I experimented with teaching the Grand Tour, combining data and historical work in ways that remain fundamental to humanistic inquiry.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"before-the-grand-tour-explorer\">Before the Grand Tour Explorer</h2>\n\n<p>I first brought the Grand Tour Project into my teachng for a course called “Modern Journeys in Ancient Lands” in 2011. This was before the Explorer was built and before a usable dataset existed. At that time in the project, we were immersed in figuring out best practices and structures for manual data extraction while simultaneously harnessing visualization as a means of exploring and understanding early modern travel. Although there was no ready database to share with the students, the class was already centered on the idea of the print <em>Dictionary</em> itself as a data source that we could study in conjunction with primary and secondary materials on eighteenth-century travel to Italy. The first part of the class covered the history of the Grand Tour and introduced the <em>Dictionary</em>, contextualizing its representations of travel to Italy. The second part of the class was project-driven: each student selected an eighteenth-century travel narrative as a primary source and then engaged in depth with it. The <em>Dictionary</em> could help to identify possibilities, with ECCO (Eighteenth-Century Collections Online, available through our university library) offering a wide range of published eighteenth-century books from which to choose. Each student’s task was to identify a research question that they would explore through data visualization, with a final project that would entail both writing a short paper and devising explanatory and exploratory images.</p>\n\n<p>These final projects required a great deal of dedication and specialized support. Indeed, the collaborative ethos at the core of digital humanities projects operated also in the classroom setting: the class TA, Sarah Murray (then also a graduate collaborator on the Grand Tour Project), and Nicole Coleman (the Academic Technology Specialist and Co-investigator for Mapping the Republic of Letters) consulted generously with students on their final projects. The results were so striking—mixing evidence produced by close readings, attentive data extraction from eighteenth-century publications, and original solutions for data visualizations—that the Department of Classics published them in its newsletter. Students focused on individual travelers, but they were able to place them in the wider context of the Grand Tour because of the class lectures and discussions, secondary readings, and close engagements with the many figures animating the <em>Dictionary</em>. They came to appreciate concretely the larger historical picture in relation to the traces—be these archival or published sources—left by individuals. They were especially attracted by the cases of women travelers such as the writers <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3395\">Lady Montagu</a> (1689-1762, travel years 1718, 1739–41, and 1746–62), who spent most of her later life in Italy, and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4512\">Mariana Starke</a> (c.1761-1838, travel years 1792-98), who also had lengthy stays in Italy; and by travels to less-visited places such as Sicily, destination for both the German Baron and diplomat J.J. Riedesel, who traveled to the island in 1767, and the British Grand Tourist <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5009\">Thomas Watkins</a> (1761-1829, travel years 1787-89). In all cases, students traced these individual journeys on maps, thanks to careful data extraction of temporal and spatial information from primary accounts. But they also added extra layers of meaning and interpretation to their visualizations—finding ways to insert depictions of timelines (representing the progression of travels but also the amount of time spent in various places), networks of social interactions (especially with Italians), and measures of appreciation expressed by the travelers for the various sites visited alongside what they focused on in each place.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"teaching-with-the-grand-tour-explorer\">Teaching with the Grand Tour Explorer</h2>\n\n<p>Once the building of the current database got under way, along with the designing of the Grand Tour Explorer as a way to interact with, browse, and download the data carefully retrieved and curated from the <em>Dictionary</em>, the possibilities for teaching with it expanded and evolved. The class “Virtual Italy: Methods for Historical Data Science,” taught in various iterations, paralleled the last three years of my work on the Grand Tour Explorer. This was, to say the least, experimental teaching, especially insofar as the class itself contributed to my thinking as the Explorer took its final shape. Much of what happened in the classroom, and in conversation with students and TAs alike, informed my approach as I thought about how best to turn the <em>Dictionary</em>’s data, as well as the complex historical reality that stands behind it, into an effective and functional research apparatus. Students in the course helped to test the Explorer, experimenting with and improving its various features. Given how integral this pedagogical experience was for completing the Explorer, I thought it essential to document and share some of that work, and I also asked the graduate student TAs to reflect on teaching such a unique class. With <em>A World Made by Travel</em> now published, any future iteration or adaptation of the class will benefit from the Explorer’s full array of finalized features, as well as this book’s additional material—from the scholars’ essays to the explanation of the making of both the <em>Dictionary</em> and our data extraction, to this section on teaching.</p>\n\n<p>I would like now to describe this class and its evolution. At its core, “Virtual Italy: Methods for Historical Data Science” focused on eighteenth-century travel accounts, with an emphasis on reading original sources and reflecting on the layering in archives—from original sources to reference works, and from analog to digital forms. But with the availability of the Explorer data, it was simultaneously a class in data science <em>and</em> digital humanities, encompassing the full arc of the work as students progressed from data transformation and analysis to interpretation and visualization. In turn, collaboration became an even more essential component of the class. Indeed, for the class’s first iteration—in the winter quarter of 2019—I received grants from the university’s Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning and from the Collaborative Teaching Program, allowing me to support Rachel Midura’s time and efforts in developing the course’s practicums. The course’s major challenge (and its ultimate payoff) was—and continues to be—figuring out how to merge the introduction of historical context, the meaning of a historical research question, the use of primary sources reflected in the Explorer database (published and manuscript travel accounts and letters, as well as archives), and analysis and interpretation of historical data. The bipartite structure of the first half of the course—with the first of two weekly classes dedicated to lectures and discussion on eighteenth-century contexts and sources, and the second focused on practicums introducing students to increasingly more complex approaches to data—embodied this balancing act.</p>\n\n<p>To generate unity within each week of the course, as well as from week to week, the syllabus progressed through readings and related practicums addressing a series of questions about the Grand Tour: “What is the Grand Tour?,” “Who were the Grand Tourists?,” “Where did travelers go?,” “For how long did they travel?,” “Why did they travel?” Students learned data analysis skills by approaching these questions; they also took stock of the general shape of the data, including its biases, limits, and possibilities. Data interpretation was thereby introduced early on in the class. Our class activities were designed to underline the importance of writing and reading as technologies of knowledge and to highlight the ways that data—both qualitative and quantitative—is found within and outside of the digital realm. For example, I made a point of reading aloud together Leopold Berchtold’s “On Committing Observations to Paper,” from his 1787 book <em>An Essay to Direct and Extend the Inquiries of Patriotic Travelers</em>. These few pages, dense with instructions on how to collect information during travels, are detailed to amusing delight; they urge, among other things, that travelers use various types of writing implements and paper notebooks, produce multiple copies of the notes, date and reference all information sources, and revisit notes soon afterward so as to organize them by topic or to include additional information. Information technology, it turns out, has a long history, one in which traveling has played its own role, and students in the class enjoyed learning to interrogate this role. In another activity, students were instructed to sketch from memory a place they know on campus within five minutes from the classroom and then to visit that place in person to correct their drawing on the spot—all to emphasize the fact that travel in the eighteenth century was also about data collection, both written and visual, and how complex the process remains. The mixing of a traditional humanistic approach with data science and computational work was also reinforced by the composition of the class’s enrollees, with students being a mix of STEM and humanities majors who learned skills from one another during their in-class group work.</p>\n\n<p>The class has continued to evolve since the first time I ran it. The fact that more scholarly work has appeared has allowed us to expand the course’s scope and to refine our focus on certain topics. For instance, as we’ve developed work on “hidden figures”—most of whom were women and servants, the latter all but invisible when surveying the print <em>Dictionary</em>—the students have read pages from Kathryn Walchester’s <em>Travelling Servants: Mobility and Employment in British Travel Writing 1750–1850</em> (2020) and from the 2017 first edition of the <em>Memoirs on the Life and Travels of Thomas Hammond, 1748–1775</em>, a rare manuscript travel account by a servant. Sarah Goldsmith’s <em>Masculinity and Danger on the Eighteenth-Century Grand Tour</em> and Catherine D’Ignazio’s and Lauren Klein’s <em>Data Feminism</em> have both informed the project and the conversation in the classroom in real time since they appeared in 2020. As new studies with their own data have become available—such as Benjamin Reilly’s 2021 article “Seasons in Italy: Northern European Travelers, Rome, and Malaria,” in the <em>Journal of Tourism and Cultural Change</em>—it has been interesting to test them against our dataset. And now that the Explorer database is itself available in open access, I expect there to be dialogues and exchanges with scholars and students at other institutions, who are using it to conduct their own inquiries. I also anticipate more data sets becoming available and more sources being digitized. As the technology continues to evolve, the class will evolve with it.</p>\n\n<p>The five practicums shared here—all created by Rachel Midura—work through some data science fundamentals using data drawn from the Grand Tour Explorer and relying exclusively on open-access sources and no dependencies. Using Google Sheets and Palladio, the practicums introduce DH projects in general and the Grand Tour Explorer in particular, then teach how to analyze data by sorting and filtering in Google Sheets, for example, to find certain categories of travelers or specific slices of time. They move on to more complex operations with pivot tables, allowing students to calculate, for instance, travelers’ ages at time of travel and the lengths of tours. Then, using Palladio, they introduce networks and network metrics, as well as spatial relationships and mapping. These practicums are examples that can be developed or adapted further. We imagine the possibility of adding other tools and exploring other topics and exercises—for example, networks of family relations among the travelers. This first set of practicums was intentionally designed to allow all data analysis and visualization to be conducted without programming skills, using only Google Sheets, Palladio, and some other platforms. But already in the past couple of years, the experience and interests of new TAs, along with students’ existing skills (or desires to acquire new skills), have led to the introduction of more computational methods. Some students, for instance, have wished to experiment with Python for data analysis; others have wanted to learn basic text-mining methods. The sample of students’ work in this section includes examples of sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and word vectors, to name a few approaches. The point is to equip students well enough that they can embrace data analysis and interpretation while identifying and working through a research question for their final projects.</p>\n\n<p>An important step in the class, reiterated again and again (and especially as students embarked on their final projects), is to introduce students to the important “absence and presence” problem in our data and to the role of visualizations in making arguments and revealing these gaps. Together with the students, we spend time thinking about what might be missing in the archives, the silences, and what might be further silenced or brought to light by data processing. My framing of these questions in <em>A World Made by Travel</em> has been enriched by these teaching moments, and many of this book’s sections in turn reinforce this pedagogical purpose. Moreover, the book’s pedagogical contribution should extend beyond the case of eighteenth-century Grand Tour of Italy. Subjects such as data curation and data editing, the necessary attention to the gaps and silences in existing data and archives, the transparent and conscious categorization of thick and dense small-scale data sets (as opposed to the illusions and perils of big data) have for years been central to thinking in the digital humanities. Lauren Klein’s codework as carework, Jo Guldi’s critical search, Katherine Bode’s data-rich analysis, and the alternative quantifying of Claire Lemercier and Claire Zalc are all finding renewed interest, while data scientists become more and more concerned with issues of bias and interested in data ethics, humanistic complexity, and source criticism.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> One persisting obstacle to the bridging of this gap between data scientists and domain experts has been the scarcity of historical data sets. The Explorer is one such digital archive. Incomplete and imperfect, yet also rich in historical layers, explicit about its own making, and posing hard questions about the categorization of data and its relationship with sources, the Explorer adds to the field’s ongoing and essential conversation about data and makes it easier to bring that conversation into the classroom.</p>\n\n<p>In the sections that follow, readers will find a sample syllabus for this course, the practicums, graduate teaching assistants’ accounts of their experiences teaching the course, and a sampling of final projects created by students during the course’s various iterations, all making use of the Grand Tour Explorer data. The fundamental principle of the class has always been to show how data might become part of humanistic and historical inquiry, and how data science can attend to context. However messy, surprising, rich, unsettling, fascinating, revealing, uncertain and incomplete those contexts may be, they are the starting point from which any exploration of the past necessarily begins.</p>\n\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p><em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy, 1701–1800</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Ford archive by John Ingamells (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1997).

Numerous performer-impresarios crossed the Channel to tour throughout Europe and beyond, offering spectacles of audacious equestrian displays. The vogue reached Italy around 1770, when the description above was written by the astounded Vicenza diarist Arnaldo Arnaldi Tornieri. The showman seen by Tornieri was probably <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5031\">William Wear</a> (travel year 1770), whose extensive Italian tour that year is widely documented.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Writing to the city authorities in Rome that summer, Wear introduced himself as a master horseman (<em>cavallerizzo</em>) wishing to show the public his <em>virtù</em> in this genre.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> Wear’s spectacular performances involved musical accompaniments, ambitious staging, and a range of publicity materials.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> At some point during his continental travels he had flyers printed illustrating his daring showmanship (<a href=\"/scholars-essays/macdonald-harlequin-horsemanship#figure-1\">fig. 1</a>).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\"> <img src=\"../macdonald-figure-1.png\" id=\"fig1\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1\">\n\nFig. 1. \nFranz Asner.

And <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5031\">Wear</a> was just one operator in a cutthroat field. Another such troupe was led by <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3976\">Peter Price</a> along with his <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3976.1\">wife</a> (travel year 1782). When Price and his companions sought permission to perform in Rome, they boasted of previous performances before courtly audiences in Britain, France, Sardinia, Prussia, Poland, and Russia. Describing their presence in Rome as part of a voyage that would ultimately take them to Constantinople, they asked for leave “to show in this Mother City the exercises of the <em>Knights of the English School</em>.”<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5031\">Wear</a>, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3976\">Price</a> and the several other British <em>cavallerizzi</em> troupes who performed in Italy around this period have not yet received substantive historical study.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> But, as this essay will propose, these Italian journeys are of interest both in their own right and also as a basis for posing larger historical questions. Touring eighteenth-century Italian cities while feting <em>virtù</em> and gallantry tends to be associated with a very different, and much more abundantly studied, type of travel—namely, the Grand Tour and its participants, a practice bound up with elite self-fashioning and the performance of sociocultural distinction.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> For relatively plebeian commercial traveling performers to draw on such elevating language was to posit themselves as <em>virtuoso</em> knights engaged in their own kind of Grand Tour.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>This essay takes the idea of a parallel juxtaposition or overlap between these very different social categories of traveler as a cue to explore questions about the actual social range of foreign visitors to Italy around this juncture. More specifically, it takes the case of these <em>cavallerizzi</em> as a vantage point for examining the prosopography of more than six thousand British and Irish travelers to Italy during the eighteenth century offered by the Grand Tour Explorer. The Explorer allows a novel point of access to the mass of valuable research material presented in <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells (1997). Appraising the social range and representativeness of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s prosopography through the interface of the Explorer necessitates an understanding of the original book’s scope and its underlying sources. Reviewed in this light, the <em>cavallerizzi</em> are discussed here as a case study of the many possibilities—as well as some of the limitations—of prosopographical inquiry into the wider social field of British and Irish travelers to Italy (<a href=\"/scholars-essays/macdonald-harlequin-horsemanship#figure-2\">fig. 2</a>).</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"figure-2\"></a></p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Entry in <i>Dictionary</i></th>\n      <th>Entry in <i>GTE<i></i></i></th>\n      <th>Sources in <i>Dictionary</i>/<i>GTE<i></i></i></th>\n      <th>Other sources and notes</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Wear</td>\n      <td>YES</td>\n      <td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5031\">YES</a></td>\n      <td>Verri, <i>Cart</i>. <br /> <i>Gazz.

I then turned to the Explorer—especially to the word search feature it offers, which greatly facilitates access to the <em>Dictionary</em> text—to seek cases beyond those I had chanced on during my initial archival research, before finally exploring further in additional sources. Happily, both <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5031\">Wear</a> and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3976\">Price</a> do, in fact, have biographical entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>. Several of their competitors also feature. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3748\">Parry</a> and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2098\">Greenwood</a> (travel year 1770), a two-man team, were in Florence in 1770, hot on Wear’s heels. A trick-rider named <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3947\">Potts</a> (travel year 1772) performed in Venice in 1772: his “feats of Horsemanship” were noted by one British tourist, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1828\">Philip Francis</a> (travel year 1772), as the only diversion then available in the city.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> Another such performer, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2568\">Charles Hughes</a> (travel year 1775), is recorded in Florence and Rome a few years later; a poster also survives advertising his performances in Venice (<a href=\"/scholars-essays/macdonald-harlequin-horsemanship#figure-3\">fig. 3</a>).<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\"> <img src=\"../macdonald-figure-3.png\" id=\"fig1\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig3&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap3\">\n\nFig. 3. <i>E giunto in questa dominante citt&agrave; il celebre signor Hughes, cavallerizzo dell&rsquo;accademia di su&agrave; maest&agrave; brittanica, del quale vengono rappresentate vari giuochi di cavallerizza, non mai pi&ugrave; veduti, e che sorprenderanno l&rsquo;universale aspettazzione</i>, wood engraving, n.d., dimensions unknown.

On the other hand, the entries in question comprise only a sentence or two, and, as will be seen below, not every British trick-rider who toured Italy made it into the text. This mixed coverage relates, in part, to the history of the <em>Dictionary</em> itself, of which the animating focus—and greatest strength in practice—is the Grand Tour milieu rather than a complete prosopography of all British and Irish travelers in eighteenth-century Italy. New research by Giovanna Ceserani has helped establish how the <em>Dictionary</em> was greatly transformed over the long period of its development. As launched by Ford in the decades after the Second World War, the venture was initially envisioned within relatively confined art historical or antiquarian limits and as a contribution to the history of taste and collecting. Over time, however, the scope of research expanded, and with it the remit of the ultimate publication.</p>\n\n<p>Elements of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s larger intellectual genealogy and context may also be suggested. First, the question of prosopography was, during the period of the project’s gestation, becoming highly topical among historians. This was especially the case in relation to the study of the eighteenth-century British political elite, notably in the wake of the influential work of Sir Lewis Namier.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup> Second, the project developed against the backdrop of what Peter Mandler has termed “sales of <em>virtù</em>”—that is, changes in ownership, over the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, of many of the private papers and collections that had been accrued during the eighteenth-century heyday of the Grand Tour.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> The dispersal of such material traces of the Grand Tour ultimately promoted wide-ranging efforts to record and study the eighteenth-century milieu involved in their initial fabrication, with the <em>Dictionary</em> offering a case in point.</p>\n\n<p>When the editorial decision was taken to produce a work that would no longer be delimited to a study of British artistic or Grand Tour–related engagement with eighteenth-century Italy, but rather an open-ended biographical dictionary attempting to document <em>all</em> travelers from Britain and Ireland to Italy during the period, this shift entailed drawing on a larger constellation of sources and then tapping them more systematically. In particular, expanding the venture’s ambition in this manner meant that, besides focusing on sources produced by travelers themselves, research for the <em>Dictionary</em> would also involve the dedicated exploration of multiple Italian archival records. Indeed, one of the signal virtues of the published <em>Dictionary</em> is that it encompasses serious study of sources relating to the monitoring, administration, or “policing,” broadly understood, of foreigners in eighteenth-century Italy. Notably, for certain cities such as Venice, relatively thorough bureaucratic records survive describing arrivals and departures by given foreigners. And these kinds of administrative sources—names on lists and registers—form a low-profile but invaluable bedrock for the <em>Dictionary</em>’s prosopography and help reveal a cast of historical actors far wider than the sociocultural elite alone.<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In a schematic way, then, the eighteenth-century sources underpinning the <em>Dictionary</em> may be considered under two main headings. First, the book described British and Irish travelers from material largely stemming from their own records, collections, and artistic productions. Second, it drew on documentation regarding such travelers and trajectories in Italian bureaucratic or policing archives. If the first set of sources are more qualitative—and, indeed, furnished much of the completed <em>Dictionary</em>’s word count and anecdotal color—then it might appear natural to consider the second as broadly quantitative. Yet, at least for the question of the social variety of travelers, this would be somewhat misleading. For not every foreigner was accorded even the basic official attention of having their arrival at a given Italian locale noted. In the Venetian registers, for example—perhaps the single most extensive source of this kind used in the <em>Dictionary</em>—often only the nominal head, usually male, of a given traveling party is explicitly named; other family members and servants frequently went unlisted, unnamed, or otherwise underdescribed. More fundamentally, efforts by eighteenth-century bureaucracies to map people in movement were never a perfect dragnet.<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> Lists and registers produced by eighteenth-century Italian administrators represented a partially realized aspiration, and sometimes a deceptive simulacrum, of all-encompassing surveillance and control, rather than a reality of full coverage. The idea of total or encyclopedic coverage is itself a historical artifact, an ambition—or rather an illusion—that fascinated Enlightenment-era administrators, reformers, and police. The <em>Dictionary</em>, indeed the very idea of a “dictionary,” partly reproduces this illusion.</p>\n\n<p>The Explorer gives the <em>Dictionary</em>’s sources, showing on which of these, and in what quantity, the entries in the text rely. Some sources on British and Irish travelers in Italy during the eighteenth century eluded the compilers of the <em>Dictionary</em>. That various private papers and other surviving miscellaneous records about individual trajectories were unavailable or missed in the book’s preparation is unsurprising and does not in itself constitute a profound heuristic handicap. A vast amount of such material would be required to effect a drastic quantitative revision to the <em>Dictionary</em>’s prosopography as published in 1997. Even if this were achieved, it seems implausible that this would produce a dramatically different qualitative picture to the existing Grand Tour–centered one. Far more significant an omission, however, was that the <em>Dictionary</em> overlooked a major set of official records which are of considerable and distinctive prosopographical value—namely, the registers of the British Protestant chapel at Leghorn/Livorno.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup> Held at the National Archives in London, the Leghorn/Livorno chapel records have to date received almost no scholarly attention.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> During the ninety-year period between the commencement of the chapel registers in 1707, until the temporary withdrawal of the British factory of merchants from Leghorn/Livorno in the late 1790s, more than eight hundred burials are listed, around four hundred baptisms, and somewhat fewer marriages. On the face of it, these are significant figures to set against the approximately six thousand traveling individuals that the Explorer has identified in its digital parsing of the entries from the <em>Dictionary</em>. Some of the names in the Leghorn/Livorno registers do already appear in the <em>Dictionary</em>, having been encountered via other sources. And the compilers drew on one proximate source that has partial overlap with the Leghorn/Livorno chapel registers—namely, a list of inscriptions in the British cemetery at Leghorn/Livorno, a work that is cited in approximately 130 entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> Other names from the registers would have been irrelevant for the <em>Dictionary</em>’s purposes, since not everyone appearing therein is British or Irish (and this is, in fact, part of their interest as a source). All told, had the Leghorn/Livorno chapel records been incorporated into the <em>Dictionary</em>, the result might well have been several hundred additional names. While representing a significant boost, this would not have radically transformed the size of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s coverage. This additional material would, however, have principally related to, and helped to further reveal, the mercantile face of British-Irish engagement with eighteenth-century Italy, instead of the more familiar Grand Tour ambit: this focus was presumably one reason why the Leghorn/Livorno registers went unnoticed in the first place. These remarks about the Leghorn/Livorno registers notwithstanding, the <em>Dictionary</em> does nonetheless feature many merchants, and the Explorer’s digital transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em>, allowing the aggregation of travelers that appear as merchants, grants them more visibility and has been the basis for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/reinert-economic-grand-tour\">Reinert</a>’s analysis of this component of the Grand Tour world.</p>\n\n<p>This review of sources animating the <em>Dictionary</em>’s prosopography might end there, were it not that, in the particular case of the <em>cavallerizzi</em>, one extraordinary additional document has recently come to light. This is a manuscript memoir that centers exactly on what its author dubs the “Break-neck Jockeyship” milieu.<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> The author in question, Thomas Hammond, worked as a servant for a trick-rider named James Wolton during an extensive Continental tour that included a season spent crossing Italy in 1770. Hammond’s account reveals a host of fascinating specifics about the trick-riders’ multifarious—and skullduggery-filled—business arrangements. Above all, it supplies the author’s own remarkable voice, opening a window onto his lived experiences and personal dramas. The production and survival of such a text, at this social level, is highly unusual. Set against the existing prosopography of the <em>Dictionary</em>, Hammond’s memoirs flesh out individuals and a milieu that otherwise would remain largely irrecoverable.</p>\n\n<p>Hammond’s picaresque narrative can be only briefly presented here. He introduces the other members of Wolton’s rackety operation, a young woman named Elizabeth Page—whom Wolton falsely presented as his wife—and “an English Lad call’d Peter, who spoke Italian.”<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> Hammond also describes encounters with competing British <em>cavallerizzi</em>, including a number of the figures noted at the start of this essay. Thus, before crossing the Alps, Wolton’s company met “Mr. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3976\">Price</a> the famous rider.” He sought to discourage them from touring Italy, declaring “that it would not answer for we should only spend our Money and get Nothing.” But it subsequently transpired that Price’s comments about Italy “were lies that he forged to detain us from going there where he had never been, but where he intended to go.” The two parties crossed paths again in Turin, pragmatically agreeing to take different Italian itineraries so that “we may not be a hindrance to each other.”<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup> A subsequent encounter with another equestrian performer, our own <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5031\">William Wear</a>, occurred just as Wolton was finalizing arrangements to perform in Venice. Such cases of crossing ways while abroad were also characteristic of the travels of more typical Grand Tourists, but this meeting occasioned a distinct outcome. Rather than seek to out-compete one another, Wolton and Wear entered into an uneasy provisional partnership. Hammond vividly described the spectacle as the audience arrived for their opening performance at “this water-built city,” held at a former riding school on the Giudecca:</p>\n\n<blockquote>The great channel from St. Mark&rsquo;s Square was Covered with Gondoloes full of Gentlemen &amp; Ladies all Mask&rsquo;d, who being seated in the Ride, look&rsquo;d like so Many specters, for their Masks were all white; and their coming over in those black Gondoloes looked as if they had been a troop of Ghosts that Mercury had conducted to the borders of the River Styx to be wafted over by the inexorable Charon into the Elysian fields, or Mansions of the Dead. However&mdash;Ugly as they were they brought us money, and we performed there twelve times.<span><sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>All of Wolton’s group, Hammond included, are conspicuously absent in the <em>Dictionary</em>. To this extent, Hammond’s memoirs attest to the imperfection of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s coverage, as discussed above.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> Yet they also substantiate its broader heuristic value, since the <em>Dictionary</em> in many ways us helps make sense of an account such as Hammond’s, especially if it is digitally searchable as in the Explorer. Seen in this light, the Explorer can best be treated as an opportunity—as an invitation to take advantage of what this material does show us—rather than lamented for incompleteness where “completeness” was never possible. The <em>Dictionary</em> as it stands, and therefore the Explorer, represents a far-reaching compilation of surviving sources, including of the relevant Italian archival material. Notwithstanding its elite focus, the <em>Dictionary</em> also contains many sidelights on “lesser” travelers. While inviting reflections about the social range of travelers, the <em>Dictionary</em> also helps to elucidate the extent to which different social groups related to—or stood apart from—one another.</p>\n\n<p>Looking beyond the trick-riders, it is possible to discover at least glimpses of other more workaday or plebeian lives in the <em>Dictionary</em>, which is made easier by scrolling through “Employments and Identifiers” in the Explorer. In most cases, nonelite individuals appear therein because of client relationships with elite patrons, notably through work in service. One striking example from the world of court patronage is <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2721\">William Joy</a> (1675–1734, travel years c. 1702–33), who was “Strong Man to the Great Duke of Tuscany” over the early decades of the century. Many such individuals feature only fortuitously and are often accorded brief entries because of some quixotic incident: <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3578\">Richard Noakes</a>, a clockmaker, recorded in Rome in 1757 as having absconded with valuables entrusted to his care; <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/719\">John Burton</a> (1730–82, travel years 1775–76 and 1782), a harpsichordist who died of fever in Naples in 1782, while in the employment of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/334\">William Beckford of Fonthill</a> (1759–1844, travel years 1780–81, 1782, and 1792); and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/753\">Mrs. Mary Cadogan</a> (d. 1810, travel years 1786–1800), the daughter of a Welsh shepherd and more famous for being the mother of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2205\">Emma Hamilton</a> (1765–1815, travel years 1786–1800). Like the trick-riders, in many ways, it is impressive that such figures appear at all in the <em>Dictionary</em>, yet all the aforementioned are simultaneously absent in the sense that their entries are relatively sparse or vacant.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> Furthermore, the <em>Dictionary</em>’s construction tends to obscure numerous other nonelite individuals. For example, it frequently clusters references to whole traveling parties in a single entry for one dominant individual, thereby reproducing eighteenth-century social hierarchies. It is notable, as well, that the <em>Dictionary</em> has no entries under the name “Anonymous.” One advantage of the Explorer is to render more visible all manner of individuals—named and unnamed—either with the creation of new entries when the digital parsing has identified these travelers or by searching the text for given keywords, such as <em>servant</em> or <em>maid</em>. Other keyword search results, however, are more salutary in obliging us to recall what a pale reflection the <em>Dictionary</em> can provide of the true proportions of nonelite travel. Thus, only one sailor, a certain <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1892\">Thomas Gardener</a> (travel year 1747), appears to have received a dedicated entry, yet presumably, the number of British and Irish mariners to have made port in Italy over the course of the century would have easily exceeded the total number of entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Equally, while the discussion here has focused on the challenges of exploring the social range of British and Irish travelers to eighteenth-century Italy through the <em>Dictionary</em>, many of the same considerations apply for additional, and sometimes overlapping, occluded groups and categories. At all social levels, women seem to be underrepresented in the <em>Dictionary</em> by comparison to their male fellow travelers. The Explorer’s digital transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em> has sought to correct this underrepresentation, at least by creating new entries for travelers (largely women) previously subsumed in others’ entries, as in the case of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3976.1\">Price’s wife</a>. Rosemary Sweet’s <a href=\"/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled\">essay</a> in the present collection has used this new data for innovative analysis, while certainly it remains true that more women traveled than we can ever recover by what the surviving sources record. Searching the Explorer for keywords relating to British colonial worlds produces far more references to individuals enriched by the spoils of empire than to subaltern lives, albeit there are a handful of exceptions to this. For example, the entry for an “English Catholic from Barbados” named <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/62\">Allen</a> (travel years 1728–30) states that “one of his black slaves became a Christian” in Rome in 1729; the Explorer created a new entry for this <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/62.1\">slave</a>, but the question persists of how many others remain unmentioned and forgotten.<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup> Furthermore, as the example of the <em>cavallerizzi</em> suggests, the Explorer can be used to trace terms relating to nonhuman actors and travelers, notably horses but also other animals. For instance, one contemporary account describes <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1760\">Martin Folkes</a> (1690–1754, travel years 1733–35) going to Rome in 1733 “with his wife and daughters, dog, cat, parrot and monkey.”<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>This essay began by highlighting how elements of the trick-riders’ self-presentation echoed the Grand Tour model. Evaluating this parallel illumines the equivocal profile that the <em>cavallerizzi</em> came to receive in the historical record—and in the <em>Dictionary</em>—but it also points to what made them prosopographically distinctive. Much of their interest, indeed, relates to how they upend traditional Grand Tour frameworks. They didn’t come to Italy to spend money, consume culture, or acquire <em>virtù</em>, nor were they part of the baggage train of Grand Tourism and its associated trades, arts, and services. Rather, they were already <em>virtuosi</em> in their field and were in Italy to make instant money from their own ephemeral productions: their displays were voguish lowbrow entertainment rather than higher-brow fare indebted to classical or artistic canons. This British engagement with Italy was more a matter of export than of import and more an epiphenomenon of eighteenth-century “Anglomania”—centered, in this case, on horse husbandry and sporting spectacle—than of fascination with Italy’s cultural capital.<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup> Indeed, some of the trick-riders scarcely wished to be there and were touring abroad simply as a contingency after having been shouldered out of the hypercompetitive “Harlequin Horsemanship” market in Britain itself.<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, one reason we are able to reconstruct these trajectories in any detail is precisely because they also had notable points of proximity and even overlap with the Grand Tour. Newspaper reports advertising <em>cavallerizzi</em> performances shared column space with reports of foreign grandees’ comings and goings. Their displays were often enacted on terrain best-known for Grand Tourism and for antiquarian interests. It was partly the presence of foreign tourists with money to spend that made Italian cities such conspicuous centers for elite consumption, including furnishing a key public for the kinds of crowd-pleasing spectacles that the <em>cavallerizzi</em> were in the business of selling. Horsemanship was itself a characteristic that could bring together diverse social categories: the art of riding was an attribute both of circus performers and of grandees.<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup> The <em>cavallerizzi</em> serve, too, as a reminder that social status was not fixed and that the purpose of a sojourn in Italy was—at all social levels—performative, competitive, and even transformative. The servant Thomas Hammond provides a remarkable example of this. Not only did Hammond transcend societal expectations by writing up his memoirs, immortalizing his life and career, but one of his text’s delights is its shifting linguistic registers—including, as we have seen, describing scenes he observed in Venice by invoking analogies with classical mythology (“those black Gondoloes looked as if they had been a troop of Ghosts that Mercury had conducted to the borders of the River Styx to be wafted over by the inexorable Charon into the Elysian fields”), thus further announcing his autodidactic virtuosity.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if some of the considerations discussed here highlight the need, when using the Explorer, to recognize the various layers of source production, survival, selection, and interpretation that have structured its contents, they also help provide an intellectual genealogy for the project itself. The “art of travel” as constructed during the early modern period was entangled with observation, recording, and collecting.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup> But so, too, were host governments anxious to register and measure the movements and activities of foreigners in their midst. One of the points of interest of the <em>Dictionary</em> is precisely that in its ambitious and innovative source base, it brings together these two documentary impulses. In terms of social coverage, the results are, if not straightforwardly quantitatively representative, nevertheless of often impressive variety. The Explorer gives us new ways of approaching this material and, indeed, of reading the <em>Dictionary</em> against the grain of its original intentions. The <em>Dictionary</em> was presented as having been primarily designed to answer questions: “Were they in Italy?” and if so, “When and where?”<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup> The Explorer, however, permits us not only to revisit such questions but to frame new ones. As this essay has sought to show, approaching this material by searching not for a named or notable individual but, instead, for wider sociocultural categories and careers can help reveal a host of more eclectic and obscure personal trajectories, with potentially kaleidoscopic results.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h1>\n\n<p>Research behind this essay was funded by a Rome Scholarship at the British School at Rome (2010–11) and a Max Weber Fellowship at the European University Institute, Florence (2015–16).

        "content"  : "<p>My interest in the Grand Tour explorer arises out of my own work on the engagement of British travelers with Italian cities during the long eighteenth century. Some years ago, I published a book that concentrated upon British experiences and representations of Italian cities during the long eighteenth century, Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c. 1690-1820.1 As an urban historian, I was less concerned with what was collected or purchased by travelers, or with their social networks, than with exploring how images of major Italian cities were constructed and considering their influence in British culture. Given the opportunity to work with the Grand Tour Explorer, I wanted to use it to pursue several questions.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Like many historians, years of immersion in the primary sources meant that I had an intuitive sense of evolving patterns of travel and the composition of the traveling body. However, I was unable to provide any rigorous quantifiable basis for my conclusions or generalizations. How far were my generalizations borne out by the evidence of the Explorer, while taking into account the complex nature of its data, which we know to be far from complete (see the introduction of the book)? What new light could the Explorer cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the Explorer tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body? The dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste, acquired and polished in Italy, exercised such a powerful influence upon Britain’s eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.2 But it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic grand tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out throughout my book was the increasing presence of both female travelers and travelers from beyond the landed elite over the course of the eighteenth century, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book: Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile: such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa and Leghorn.</p>\n"

        "content"  : "<p>By the seventeenth century, British travelers had already caught the travel bug. They expressed sentiments strikingly similar to those of modern globetrotters. An early “Grand Tour” account, <em>Coryat’s Crudities</em> (1611), satirized how even the hint of foreign climes could infect an armchair traveler: “A Dutch Post doth ravish him. The mere superscription of a letter from Zurich sets him up like a top: Basil or Heidelberg makes him spinne. And at seeing the word Frankford, or Venice, though but on the title of a Booke, he is readie to breake doublet, cracke elbowes, and overflowe the roome with his murmure.<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>This was wanderlust as mania, brought on by an increasingly interconnected world. Adventurers were tempted by the Dutch packets, Swiss letters, and Italian books that had made their way north as far as Oxford and London. Thomas Coryate and many of his compatriots answered their siren calls, setting forth from their armchairs into the wider world.</p>\n\n<p>Coryate would later claim to have walked much of his journey from France to Italy and the Netherlands. His book begins with several poems referencing his shoes, which hung for many years at his local church in Somerset. But Coryate did not always walk: even at the outset of his journey, he described his wanderlust in terms of how ardently he desired “having trussed up his necessaries, and packed up his fardels, to draw on his bootes, put his riding hat upon his head, raise himselfe upon his wings, hoise sailes, and mount on horsbacke (according to the proverbe) and post the neerest way to forraine and remote Nations.”<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Sentences like these hint at the variety of travel modes available in seventeenth-century Europe. Coryate’s reference to the ravishing “Dutch Post” as a noun parallels the modern use of <em>post</em> as a synonym for <em>mail</em>. Both the noun and verb (“to post”) had only recently entered the British lexicon, from the Italian term for a staging post, or way stations that enabled riders to travel in relay.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> When Coryate used <em>post</em> as a verb instead and synonym for travel (to “post the nearest way”), he used even newer slang. The proliferation of “to post,” “go by post,” or travel “post-haste” demonstrated that the import of European travel modes to Britain was intertwined with the arrival of British tourists in Europe.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>When it works well, travel infrastructure is virtually invisible. Instead, we often find mentions of its perceived failures. Take, for example, free word searching in the Grand Tour Explorer for <em>postilion</em> (a guide hired from the post): <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2843\">George Lewis Langton</a> (c. 1716–38, travel years 1737–38) was “much harrassed [<em>sic</em>] by postillions, inn-keepers and coaching accidents,” and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4434\">Tobias Smollet</a> (1721–71, travel years 1764–71) wrote that “the hostlers, postilions, and other fellows hanging about the post-houses in Italy, are the most greedy, impertinent, and provoking.” The Hon. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/766\">Benedict Leonard Calvert</a> (c. 1701–32, travel years 1724–25) had good reason to complain when his postilion drove into a ditch, breaking the chaise of the carriage and forcing him to return to Rome rather than journey onward to Naples. Travelers complained at length about the behavior of postilions, poor condition of paved roads, and inadequacy of travel inns. Coryate’s work and hundreds of other British travel narratives are often analyzed for the sensory or philosophical experience of travel.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> Such sources do provide vivid details of exceptional experiences, but more mundane infrastructure frequently escapes notice.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth considering that such complaints reveal high expectations.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> By the beginning of the seventeenth century, British tourists expected a great deal of a comprehensive travel infrastructure that had simply not existed in past centuries. The history of travel necessitates quantitative, in addition to qualitative, evidence. The Grand Tour Explorer offers a unique opportunity to study travel patterns across space, time, and political boundaries. With this broader perspective, we can determine how representative the most famous and widely published travelers were. This essay will set out to do so with an experience common to all Grand Tourists: their arrival in Italy. British travelers faced an arduous journey before ever reaching Italian soil. The compilers of the <em>Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em> were not preoccupied with that journey, yet as the Explorer reveals, the entries preserve many traces. Around 150 locations outside of Italy appear in the tour information, constituting 34.3 percent of all locations recorded, the majority of which lie north of the Alps.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>To date, Mont Cenis has traditionally been identified as the preferred Alpine pass of the Grand Tour. Jeremy Black wrote that “the most common route into Italy was from Lyons through the Duchy of Savoy, over the Mt. Cenis pass to Susa, and thence to Turin.”<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> Christopher Hibbert similarly saw most Grand Tourists as venturing first to France, before choosing “to cross the Alps either through Grenoble, Briancon, and Cesana, or through Geneva and Switzerland,” while “the most usual route was by way of Lanslebourg and Susa over Mont Cenis.”<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> Recent authors are more equivocal, but the Savoyard route continues to receive the most scholarly attention.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> Other essays collected here use free word searches to great effect, but the approach offers little guidance in this instance. Searches of the entry text and locations for famous Alpine passes (see <a href=\"/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival#figure-1\">fig. 1</a>) turn up very little information: Mont Cenis returns the greatest number of results, with forty-four matching entries, while the Brenner Pass produces only five entries, the St. Gotthard only two, and the St. Bernard passes do not appear at all.<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup> This essay will seek to read across the geography of the tour data to infer regions of entry into Italy and the modes of travel being used. Inferring the Alpine pass of entry into Italy from the Explorer data reveals that traveler choices were more varied than typically assumed and often tied to travel infrastructure.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\"> <img src=\"../midura-figure-1.png\" alt=\"A relief map of Northern Italy showing major mountain passes, and cities categorized by color-coded regions.

The <em>Dictionary</em> bisects the history of travel with a largely arbitrary date of 1700. By putting study of the Explorer in dialogue with earlier sources—including Thomas Coryate, among many others—we may better understand the <em>longue durée</em> of the Grand Tour, as well as its significance as a reflection of improving travel infrastructure.<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> Postal routes and way stations marked improvements in “soft infrastructure” that predated many road-engineering projects. Alpine passes were fundamentally limited in number in the early modern world, and very little construction to add new routes took place between the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries.<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup> The travel of eighteenth-century British Grand Tourists can be fruitfully compared to earlier centuries as a reflection of the shifting preferences and conditions for, rather than geographical possibilities of, transalpine travel.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-longue-durée-of-the-grand-tour-structural-factors-for-arrival-in-italy\">The <em>Longue Durée</em> of the Grand Tour: Structural Factors for Arrival in Italy</h1>\n\n<p>Grand Tourists were familiar with the long history of Italy’s Roman roads, employing Latin names and mapping their travels onto those described by classical authors. The Roman Empire established an early pattern of travel infrastructure radiating outward from Italy into other parts of Europe. The Via Julia Augusta (c. 13 BCE) followed the coast of Liguria, linking Genoa to Marseille, while the Via Claudia Augusta (c. 46/47 CE) linked the Veneto region to the Tyrol and beyond, by way of the Brenner Pass. Archaeological evidence indicates additional Roman roads in the region of the Simplon Pass in the first centuries of the new millennium, likely related to the campaigns of Septimius Severus I (193–211 CE).<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> Grand Tourists primarily remembered exceptional Alpine crossings, from Hannibal’s legendary elephants (218 CE) to Charlemagne (800 CE) and Frederick Barbarossa’s imperial armies (c. 1154–75 CE).</p>\n\n<p>As Roman infrastructure fell into disrepair, smaller-scale mobility continued throughout the Middle Ages. Transalpine trade linked the hubs of northern Italy with France, particularly the trade fairs in the region of Champagne. The closure of these fairs in the early fourteenth century saw a rise in traffic across the eastern Alpine passes, as merchants sought new transalpine connections between Bologna, Venice, Nuremberg, and Augsburg. Some merchants even took basic road building into their own hands: Bozen merchant Heinrich Kunter sponsored the building of a mule road through the Eisack Gorge along the Brenner Pass in 1314.<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> In the sixteenth century, the Fugger family of merchant bankers paid to revitalize parts of the Via Claudia Augusta, referred to as the <em>Römerstrasse</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Transalpine regions had been the birthplace for much of early modern travel and communication infrastructure. The Tassis family—whose ancestral home in Camerata Cornello was located along the medieval Via Mercatorum—was one of several families contracted to build and manage routes for early modern states. Better known by their later title of Thurn und Taxis, this communications dynasty played a crucial role in the Venetian, Papal, Spanish, and Austrian Habsburg systems from the fifteenth century onward.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> Responding to news-hungry patrons, from princes to bankers, they established postal routes dotted with way stations with horses kept ready for riding in relay. Many of these way stations were themselves inns, where the innkeeper might rent out horses to travelers when they were not otherwise in use. The Tassis established such way stations along historical routes from Milan to the Netherlands through Chur in 1496 and from Milan to Innsbruck in 1517.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup> To travel “by the post” encompassed several modes by as early as the sixteenth century. The first was to rent a “post horse,” then travel with or without a guide (a “postilion,” or <em>postiglione</em>) along the postal road, paying a fee for the return of the horse to its owner at the end of the journey. The second was to travel by one’s own means along the postal road, taking advantage of the stops. The British adopted the Italian <em>ordinari</em>, which usually referred to couriers traveling on a set timetable, to refer instead to the “ordinaries,” or postal inns. By the early seventeenth century, the third option was often to travel via a public postal coach, often referred to as the “post-chaise” (from the French) or “diligence” (from the German).<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>By the mid-seventeenth century, the British were frequently as steeped in the culture of postal transport as their Continental counterparts—despite the relatively late advent of their own state-run service.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> The language of the post percolated from Italy across Europe in the sixteenth century: <em>posta</em>, <em>ordinario</em>, <em>procaccio</em> (a single route carrier), <em>vetturino</em>, and <em>nolesino</em> (referring to coaches for hire). The term <em>post-haste</em> made a notable appearance in Shakespeare’s plays.<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup> British translators made postal itinerary books available to English audiences with Richard Verstegan’s <em>The Post of the World</em> (1576), John Wadsworth’s <em>The European Mercury</em> (1641), and Edmund Warcupp’s <em>Italy in Its Original Glory</em> (1660).<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The paths of British travelers were dispersed across a broad geography from their points of entry onto the Continent, but they were grouped together once more upon reaching the Alps. Liguria had several coastal routes, including the aforementioned Via Julia Augusta through Savona. Travelers coming from Geneva often crossed Savoy and traveled through the Mont Cenis and St. Bernard Passes (known as the “Little,” and “Great,” respectively); meanwhile, Lombardy channeled travelers from other parts of Switzerland through the Simplon, St. Gotthard, and San Bernardino Passes. Finally, the Venetian/Tyrolean region received tourists from southern Germany and Austria, most often via the Brenner Pass.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The Alps themselves posed a formidable obstacle (see <a href=\"/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival#figure-2\">fig. 2</a>), but British travelers became more accustomed to the passage over the seventeenth century. Most land routes had long portions that could only be passed on foot, on mule, or by sedan chair. Early seventeenth-century traveler Fynes Moryson preserved a particularly vivid image. He described pressing his face to his horse’s neck, fearing he would fall at any moment.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> Thomas Coryate recalled the storms during his summer passage of 1608 through Savoy as particularly horrible.<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> In the later seventeenth century, the Alps occasioned less fearful commentary. With the exception of his fear of the “rough way,” Richard Lassels described his 1650s voyage through the Simplon Pass as “forward enough,” barring poor weather. He particularly endorsed the route through Mont Cenis, describing it as the Alps in “text hand,” comparing the topography to neat script, as opposed to areas that seemed “foule over” or “in a running hand.”<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> François Maximilien Misson offered one of the first proto-Romantic accounts of the Alps, writing that “their Snowy tops are mingled with the Clouds, and resemble very much the swelling and foaming Waves of a tempestuous and raging Sea.”<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> The growing geological and scenographic attraction of the Alps for British travelers is a well-documented phenomenon.<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n    \n<a name=\"figure-2\"> <img src=\"../midura-figure-2.jpeg\" alt=\"A snowy mountain landscape with icy rock formations.

Protestants like Fynes Moryson professed fear of capture by Spanish troops and inquisitors, but it was hard to beat these regions for travel infrastructure in the seventeenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> Venice and Milan were notable centers of early Tassis postal development with well-developed postal roads and travel modes for rent. A long-standing agreement between Milan and the merchant porters of Lindau in Bavaria allowed for a more formalized postal route by the late seventeenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> By 1710, four-span carriages traveled along the postal road between Innsbruck and Bolzano three to four times a week.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> Second, we see that many early travelers, like their later counterparts, preferred to exit Italy from a different region than the one through which they entered, likely motivated by a desire for travel breadth and variety. Third, many of these examples confirm that travelers preferred the dangers of the Alps to the perils of the sea.<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a name=\"figure-3\"></a></p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Travel account</th>\n      <th>Travel dates</th>\n      <th>Region(s) of entry into Italy</th>\n      <th>Region(s) of departure from Italy</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Thomas William</td>\n      <td><i>The Historie of Italie</i> (MS)</td>\n      <td>1540s</td>\n      <td>Naples</td>\n      <td>Lombardy</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Thomas Hoby</td>\n      <td><i>A Book of the Travaile and Lief of Me Thomas Hoby</i> (MS)</td>\n      <td>1547–64</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Sir Edward Unton</td>\n      <td>Diary (MS)</td>\n      <td>1564</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n      <td>Lombardy</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Sir Phillip Sidney</td>\n      <td>Letters (MS)</td>\n      <td>1575</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Fynes Moryson</td>\n      <td><i>An Itinerary. . .

A hand-curated table of British travelers to Italy across the seventeenth century, with regions of entry and exit identified from published accounts and <i>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</i> data. Travelers such as Moryson and Lassels made multiple trips, utilizing different passes.\n\n</figcaption>\n    \n</figure>\n\n<p>The data shown in <a href=\"/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival#figure-3\">figure 3</a> has distinct limitations. These are but a handful of travelers, and each identification requires consulting their accounts individually. We are left with little sense of how representative these journeys were or of how trends evolved over time. By contrast, the Grand Tour Explorer allowed me to rapidly infer the regions of entry of eighteenth-century British travelers into Italy. This approach was made possible by both the constrained geography of Alpine passes and the sequential records of locations provided in the Explorer entries. If, for example, an individual is first recorded in Turin and then Milan, it is reasonable to infer that they entered Italy by way of a Savoyard Alpine pass. Clues can be read alongside select traveler accounts and supplemented by a knowledge of contemporary travel infrastructure. While closer to Verona than Milan “as the crow flies,” Mantua had long been integrated into Habsburg transit infrastructure in northern Italy. It is reasonable to infer that a traveler who arrived in Mantua did so by way of the Lombard passes, especially when such an arrival was not preceded by any mention of cities in the Veneto or Tyrol regions. It is important not to overdetermine the specificity of results from such a method. It would be misguided, for example, to infer a single route. Regional groups represent collections of routes, such as “Lombardy,” which encompasses the Simplon, St. Gotthard, and San Bernardino Passes, among others. These regional groupings and their associated cities can be found listed in the legend and are color-coded accordingly in <a href=\"/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival#figure-1\">figure 1</a>. They are necessitated by both the ambiguities of real geography and those of travel modes. Arrival in a port city such as Venice or Genoa might indicate a journey by sea rather than over land. Definitively parsing all instances would require archival study outside of the Explorer. We can, however, see whether the trajectory of travel through the Tyrol/Veneto more closely parallels that of a region reached by port, such as Tuscany, or regions reached primarily by land, such as Lombardy.<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> While imperfect, such an inferential methodology fills in for a noteworthy absence. Alpine passes rarely appear by name in entry texts, and even more rarely as explicit destinations.</p>\n\n<p>The method is also not appropriate for use with all traveler entries. The following analysis uses a subset of 999 travelers from the Explorer for which a region of entry into Italy can be reasonably inferred, based on two criteria: first, each traveler has to be associated with at least three locations overall. Second, departure from the first location in Italy (regarded as the point of entry) must be followed by another location recorded within the month. This selection is intended to serve as a counterweight to sparse data. It is difficult to say whether a traveler recorded in only a single location entered Italy in that manner or whether three locations visited over the course of several decades should constitute a sequence of travel. These strict criteria produce a small subset compared to the <em>Explorer</em>’s total of 6,007 travelers, but a large one by comparison to any hand-selected subset, such as that shown in <a href=\"/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival#figure-3\">figure 3</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival#figure-4\">Figure 4</a> shows the results smoothed by a moving average across the five years preceding and following the apparent date of entry for travelers.<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup> While Savoy and Mont Cenis predominated as regions of entry among identified travelers between 1751 and 1770—the decades of a notable increase in overall travel—that was not the case earlier in the century. In fact, travelers appear to have preferred the Venetian/Tyrolean region through the first half of the eighteenth century. And while the Savoyard passes maintained a steady flow of travelers during periods of French-English warfare from 1771 to 1790, the Tyrolean/Venetian region boomed by comparison.<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup> Many of the caveats that hold true for the original biographical dictionary still necessarily apply, and the Explorer introduces some additional ones. For example, the lifespan of certain sources certainly impacts recorded travelers. As explained in Ingamells’s original “Note on Method” and <a href=\"/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled\">mentioned by Rosemary Sweet</a> and others, the University of Padua matriculation records were the source for a great number of the overall travels to the city recorded in the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup> These records became less comprehensive over time. Additionally, the Explorer’s transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entries disaggregated some large groups of travelers, perhaps disproportionately affecting the data for my study. See, for example, the numerous family of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4692\">Rev. Edward Taylor</a> (1734–98, travel years 1789–92), many of whom accompanied him from Austria to Verona in 1789 and who constituted ten of the twenty-one travelers recorded entering via the Tyrol/Veneto that year.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\"> <img src=\"../midura-figure-4.png\" alt=\"Line graph showing travel trends for five Italian cities from 1700-1800.

While Grand Tour literature has tended to link British travels in Italy with travels in France, the data indicates the need for deeper consideration of Austria and Germany as pre-Italian destinations. These regions had their own appeal to travelers like <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2188\">Sir James, the 4th Baronet Hall</a> (1761–1832, travel years 1784–85), who spent a year in Central and Eastern Europe studying “mining, archaeological sites and volcanology.” Many travelers through the Tyrolean/Venetian region came from Vienna. Some were more traditionally elite tourists, such as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2203\">Douglas Hamilton, the 8th Duke of Hamilton</a> (1756–99, travel years 1775–76), who traveled with his tutor, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3413\">Dr. John Moore</a> (1729–1802, travel years 1775–76), or <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1030\">Lady Coke</a> (1726–1811, travel years 1773–74), who greatly admired the Empress Theresa and reputedly displayed a “frenzy for royalty.” Yet a number of these travelers held military commissions and visited Vienna, then Venice, during the conflicts of the mid-1770s, perhaps during their military studies; see, for example, the Hon. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3175\">Robert Manners</a> (1758–1823, travel year 1779) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5229\">Nathaniel William Wraxall</a> (1751–1831, travel year 1779).<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The city of Venice was itself a popular draw for tourists, raising the issue of how closely entry through a given region can be associated with the popularity of its cities. If we look at the overall popularity of Venice as a destination across the Grand Tour Explorer data, we see that it does not map exactly onto the preference for the Tyrol/Veneto as a region of entry. Venice experienced a surge of travelers from 1761 to 1770, when the Tyrolean/Venetian passes were at an overall low point in popularity.<sup id=\"fnref:40\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></sup> In fact, the popularity of a city may have had a greater impact on tourists’ choice to end, rather than begin, a journey in that region. A sea voyage from Venice would notably allow tourists to ship home art and other objects collected in the course of their journeys.</p>\n\n<p>Imperial and Venetian posts were among the most advanced and comprehensive postal infrastructures of the early seventeenth century. It was possible to travel by imperial post alone from the Netherlands to Innsbruck, where the passage to Venice by coaches for hire was run by a consortium of Augsburg merchants. Misson highlights the stagecoaches that went from Augsburg to Venice as early as the 1680s.<sup id=\"fnref:41\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></sup> Despite the attempts by the Tassis (now Thurn und Taxis) postmasters to combat their competitors, a number of such regional postal systems connected major trade centers in the Holy Roman Empire, no doubt easing British travel.<sup id=\"fnref:42\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></sup> For travelers concerned about the practicalities of reaching Italy, the journey through Central Europe rather than France held a certain appeal.</p>\n\n<p>When was the turning point in favor of the Mont Cenis and St. Bernard Passes and Savoy as a region of entry? In 1720, Victor Amadeus II, the Duke of Savoy became king of Sardinia, turning his court into a royal one. Travelers such as the <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/556\">Rev. Thomas Brand</a> (c. 1751–1814, travel years 1782–84, 1787, 1790–95) delighted in court life, describing how “we go on in the old way playing snug rubbers at Whist at the Spanish Ambassadors &amp; dressing ourselves two or three times a week to shew off our persons to advantage &amp; captivate the hearts &amp; Eyes of the great Circles.” Yet the Explorer data shows no immediate change, and few travelers entered through Savoy in the 1720s (see <a href=\"/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival#figure-5\">fig. 5</a>).<sup id=\"fnref:43\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></sup> A much more notable increase began in the 1750s, reaching a peak of twenty-five identified travelers in 1763 (twenty-four of the thirty-nine identified travelers for that year, or 62 percent). <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4475\">John Spencer, the 1st Viscount Spencer</a> (1734–83, travel years 1763–64, 1769–70), was the leader of a particularly large and well-documented entourage that year; however, there was a general pattern of increasing traffic. Travelers tended to arrive in Savoy en route from Paris (twenty-three travelers), Geneva (thirteen travelers), and Nice (eleven travelers). In 1743, Savoy gained possession of the Val d’Ossola and Val Anzasca Passes from Austrian Lombardy. A new agreement between Savoy and Bern the next year restructured and facilitated transit between the two regions. Yet in 1748, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2575\">David Hume</a> (1711–76, travel year 1748) and his companions remained unimpressed by the bad roads of Turin, which caused delays from the “breaking of Wheels.”</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5\"> <img src=\"../midura-figure-5.png\" alt=\"Line graph depicting travel trends in two Italian cities between 1700-1780.

Visualization smoothed by moving average of +5/&minus;5 years.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>At the same time, the Austrian Habsburgs set out an ambitious program for infrastructural reform. From the middle of the eighteenth century, they controlled both the Lombard St. Gotthard and Venetian Brenner Passes. In the 1750s and 1760s, Empress Maria Theresa seized control of the Tyrolean postal service and implemented renewal of both the system itself and the roads. The imperial post achieved a major coup in 1764 by successfully negotiating a mail coach to supplement the existing line across the Brenner Pass. Even travelers who utilized private carriages benefited from associated improvements. As overall British tourism increased, the Tyrolean/Venetian region saw a large proportion of visitors, notably outpacing Savoy once again by around 1774.</p>\n\n<p>While Grand Tour scholars like Jeremy Black have indicated that war caused little disruption in existing travel patterns, it does appear that soured Anglo-French relations may have made a significant difference.<sup id=\"fnref:44\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></sup> Bianchi notes that the Savoyard route was largely closed to British travelers in the 1740s as a result of the War of Austrian Succession (1740–48).<sup id=\"fnref:45\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></sup> The period of the American and French Revolutions also saw a dip in overall travelers, reaching a particular low in 1781, when only 217 travelers are recorded in the Explorer. Only one of these has been identified as entering Italy via the given regions in this year: the Hon. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3492\">Gen. James Murray</a> (1719–94, travel years 1781–82), who fled the French siege of Minorca. The anomalous peak in travelers entering Italy via Liguria in 1778 (nine of twenty-five identified travelers that year, or 36 percent) was likely due to restricted options. The very next year saw the capture of the Westmoreland and plunder of many Grand Tourist souvenirs by Spanish ships.<sup id=\"fnref:46\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></sup> Occupations rather than tourism brought others to Italy, such as the surgeon <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/855\">Thomas Gideon Caulet</a> (travel years 1778–79), or the musician <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1215\">John Crosdill</a> (1755–1825, travel year 1778).</p>\n\n<p>Do these shifts show a corresponding shift in preference for travel by sea or travel by land? If that were the case, we would expect to see Lombardy and Savoy (land routes) peak in periods when Liguria and “Other” (a category including most regions that could be reached only by sea) were at a low and vice versa (see <a href=\"/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival#figure-4\">fig. 4</a>). We instead see a more complex picture: Liguria and Tuscany show an inverse relationship, particularly from 1778 forward (see <a href=\"/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival#figure-6\">fig. 6</a>). The rivalry of ports seems a more influential factor: as the popularity of the port of Leghorn/Livorno grew, the popularity of the port of Genoa fell, at least with British Grand Tourists.<sup id=\"fnref:47\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-6\"> <img src=\"../midura-figure-6.png\" alt=\"Line graph depicting travel trends in two Italian cities between 1700-1800.

Line graph demonstrating the shifting numbers of travelers entering via Liguria and Tuscany. Visualization smoothed by moving average of +5/&minus;5 years.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Across the graph, we see several phases of regional preferences for entry into Italy. The overall increase in travelers over the course of the 1720s and 1730s likely continued trends from the later seventeenth century. Early travelers appreciated the convenience and safety of Continental postal routes, particularly the coaches that ran over the Brenner Pass. From around 1730 forward, the number of travelers through this region dwindled, reaching a low around the beginning of the 1750s, just as the Savoyard passes increased in popularity. The timing suggests that infrastructural reform, rather than the new royal court, likely played a role. Subsequent decades saw important reforms by the Austrian Habsburgs, including consolidation and improvement of postal routes, particularly the advent of an official postal coach across the Alps. During the troubled decades of the 1770s and 1780s, most regions saw fewer travelers entering Italy, leaving Liguria briefly prominent among entry points. By the 1790s, tourism had recovered somewhat overall, but entry via Venice reached record numbers, and the Tuscan port of Leghorn/Livorno showed steady growth, suggesting perhaps a new turn to travel by sea, even in the age of rising tourist interest in the Alps.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"tastemakers-and-mont-cenis-traveler-preferences-for-arrival-into-italy\">Tastemakers and Mont Cenis: Traveler Preferences for Arrival into Italy</h1>\n\n<p>Scarcity of data challenges statistical analysis, but we might make some general observations to paint a better picture of the “typical” tourist and his or her choices, particularly by status and gender (see <a href=\"/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival#figure-7\">fig. 7</a>).<sup id=\"fnref:48\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:48\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></sup> The greatest number of identified travelers were males without noble titles. Some, like the composer <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5047\">Charles Weichsell</a> (c. 1766–1805, travel years 1794–1801), landed first in Naples.<sup id=\"fnref:49\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:49\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></sup> Untitled men arriving via the Alps seem most likely to have done so via Savoy. The greatest overall difference between titled and untitled men was, in fact, the Ligurian route, which titled men were more likely to have utilized than were their untitled counterparts. Many travelers came to Genoa from France, often taking a <em>felucca</em>, a type of rowboat, as Joseph Addison described in his published account: “we here took a little Boat to creep along the Sea-shore as far as Genoa; but at Savona, finding the Sea too rough, we were forced to make the best of our way by Land, over very rugged Mountains and Precipices: For this Road is much more difficult than that over Mount Cenis.”<sup id=\"fnref:50\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:50\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">50</a></sup> <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2121\">Thomas Egerton, Baron Grey de Wilton</a> (1749–1814, travel years 1785, 1788), recorded his journey from Nice to Genoa by sea in 1784, writing that he had stayed at the <em>Hotel du Grand Cerf</em> in Nice before departing for Genoa on a felucca. Many tourists opted to enter Italy via Liguria on their second tour, perhaps suggesting a desire for speed rather than sightseeing; these travelers included <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2592\">Alexander Gordon, Marquess of Huntly</a> (c. 1678–1728, travel years 1703–4, 1717), in 1717; and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3919\">Thomas Fermor, the 1st Earl of Pomfret</a> (1698–1753, travel years 1718–19, 1739–42), in 1739. Among titled men, there appears to have been a slight preference for the Tyrol/Veneto Passes; however, among men of both statuses, the distribution between Savoy and Tyrol/Veneto was relatively even.</p>\n\n<p>Distribution of travelers by region (%)</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"figure-7\"></a></p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Titled status</th>\n      <th>Liguria</th>\n      <th>Lombardy</th>\n      <th>Savoy</th>\n      <th>Tyrol/Veneto</th>\n      <th>Tuscany</th>\n      <th>Other</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>All</b></td>\n      <td><b>12.05</b></td>\n      <td><b>3.43</b></td>\n      <td><b>18.54</b></td>\n      <td><b>20.67</b></td>\n      <td><b>19.37</b></td>\n      <td><b>31.23</b></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Men (all)</b></td>\n      <td><b>11.12</b></td>\n      <td><b>3.19</b></td>\n      <td><b>19.27</b></td>\n      <td><b>20.26</b></td>\n      <td><b>19.16</b></td>\n      <td><b>32.05</b></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Untitled men</td>\n      <td>9.94</td>\n      <td>3.04</td>\n      <td>19.06</td>\n      <td>18.65</td>\n      <td>19.34</td>\n      <td>34.12</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Titled men</td>\n      <td>15.76</td>\n      <td>3.80</td>\n      <td>20.11</td>\n      <td>26.63</td>\n      <td>18.48</td>\n      <td>23.91</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Women (all</b>)</td>\n      <td><b>16.96</b></td>\n      <td><b>4.68</b></td>\n      <td><b>14.62</b></td>\n      <td><b>22.81</b></td>\n      <td><b>20.47</b></td>\n      <td><b>26.90</b></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Untitled women</td>\n      <td>13.74</td>\n      <td>6.11</td>\n      <td>12.21</td>\n      <td>24.43</td>\n      <td>16.79</td>\n      <td>30.53</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Titled women</td>\n      <td>27.50</td>\n      <td>0.00</td>\n      <td>22.50</td>\n      <td>17.50</td>\n      <td>32.50</td>\n      <td>15.00</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap7\">\n\nFig. 7. Table showing regional distribution (%) by traveler gender and titled status (travelers of unknown gender not shown). Titled status was ascertained by a combination of regular expressions and hand verification. Despite the overall popularity of the Savoyard and Tyrol/Veneto regions, the data suggests ways in which demographics may have shaped traveler preferences.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The routes of female travelers—who often traveled with, or were recorded by, other male travelers—map onto male travel patterns with a few interesting exceptions. First, both titled and untitled women were more likely to arrive via Liguria than their male counterparts. Unlike the men, untitled women were even more likely than their titled counterparts to arrive by this route, with many entries describing that they traveled by sea. Examples include <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/852\">Miss Mary Anne Cathcart</a> (Mary Mainie, 1727–74, travel years 1744–46), who journeyed from Lisbon to Genoa in 1744; and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2533\">Laetitia Houblon</a> (1742–1828, travel years 1788–89) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5012\">Betsy Watson</a> (travel years 1788–89), both of whom came from Nice in 1788. Second, titled women appear more likely to arrive via Tuscany than any other group. Ten of the total thirty-seven identified titled female travelers were first recorded in Pisa, Lucca, or Florence. Their arrival by sea is rarely explicitly mentioned in the entries but can be reasonably inferred.<sup id=\"fnref:51\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:51\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></sup> Similarly, while the complete absence of titled women entering Italy via Lombardy may be a simple lack of data, it does seem, overall, to be one of the least popular routes for female travelers. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3324\">Anne Miller</a> (1741–81, travel years 1770–71), <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3880\">Hester Piozzi</a> (1741–1821, travel years 1784–87), and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4512\">Mariana Starke</a> (1762–1838, travel years 1792–98) came to Italy by way of Savoy, although Starke recommended that travelers avoid the Alps by sailing to Leghorn/Livorno or Pisa.<sup id=\"fnref:52\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></sup> The possibility that women increasingly found sea travel more commodious than travel by land is worthy of further exploration. It may well have offered more privacy and safety to women who could afford it. The published travel accounts of elite men and women also routinely advertised the Savoyard route as one of the safest and most pleasant, likely influencing future travelers.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, we may merely indicate that as recorded by the <em>Dictionary</em>, there was a general preference for arrival via either the Tyrol/Veneto or Savoy Alpine Passes, from which certain key groups diverged. Women on the whole were more likely to arrive via Liguria, most likely by sea. Titled women were especially likely to arrive via Savoy, although Tuscany was also widely popular. If we consider only travelers prior to 1751, we see that these gender and titled-status patterns generally hold true across time, despite the overall balance between Savoy and the Tyrol/Veneto being more evenly distributed in the earlier half of the century. The prescriptiveness of published Grand Tour accounts, which sought to instruct their readers in the “correct” tour, have contributed to the notion of a single Grand Tour itinerary. We see from this study how titled men and women, particularly during the peak years of the eighteenth-century tour, preferred a Savoyard route, no doubt contributing to the scholarly perception. Yet as several essays collected here demonstrate, British travelers planned different “tours” on the basis of their gender, profession, means, and personal desire. Travel experience was also shaped by changing roads and travel modes, which were subject to periodic tides of interruption, destruction, and renewal. The Grand Tour Explorer offers us the unique ability to read travel itineraries across time, while considering such varied perspectives. We see evidence for continuity in travel patterns from the late seventeenth century into the eighteenth, as tourists continued to visit Austria and Germany, as well as France, prior to their arrival in Italy. The postal infrastructural improvements made in Savoy likely contributed to its brief peak as the predominant pass of entry, but the restructuring of the Tyrol/Veneto regional infrastructure brought it back to prominence by the end of the eighteenth century. Even so, not every group experienced these shifts to the same degree: women overall showed an early and consistent preference for travel via Liguria. Titled women had a strong early preference for Savoy, suggesting they may have played an important role as “tastemakers.” The Explorer highlights, on the whole, the diversity of tours and the many factors guiding British travelers to their arrival in Italy.</p>\n\n<div class=\"dataButton\" onclick=\"window.open('https://purl.stanford.edu/hg310rz7407','mywindow');\">Download and explore the data behind this essay</div>\n\n<h1 id=\"notes\">Notes</h1>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>Thomas Coryate, <em>Coryat’s Crudities: Hastily Gobled Up in Five Months Travells in France, Savoy, Italy, Rhetia Commonly Called the Grisons Country, Helvetia Alias Switzerland, Some Parts of High Germany and the Netherlands</em> . . .

        "content"  : "<p>The Grand Tour was critical to establishing the demand for many of the resources and phenomena that we associate with modern cultural tourism, such as maps, guidebooks, itineraries, souvenirs, and tour guides. On his visit to Rome in 1644, the British writer John Evelyn toured with one of the latter, “who get their living onely by leading strangers about to see the Citty.”<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Scant information survives on seventeenth-century guides, but the call for their services continued as the popularity of travel grew. Known in the eighteenth century as <em>ciceroni</em>, or cicerones, guides explicated the great antiquities, artworks, buildings, and sights of Italy to visitors who came from all over Europe to see them.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Tourists, especially young men for whom travel was intended to be educational, may also have been escorted by “bear leaders,” tutors, or governors, but these were chaperones rather than guides and sometimes accompanied their charges on tours with <em>ciceroni</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> This essay will examine the work of <em>ciceroni</em> and the experiences of their clients on the Grand Tour.</p>\n\n<p>Although there have been a few studies of individual <em>ciceroni</em>, they have not been considered systematically as a group. Relatively few <em>ciceroni</em> are known to us, most of them British, along with some Italians and at least one German. The fundamental published source for many of these figures is <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy 1701-1800</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Ford archive by John Ingamells, but it is not indexed, so information can be difficult to find in its entries.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> The Grand Tour Explorer’s digital transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em> allowed me to begin a more thorough study of the subject.</p>\n\n<p>The terms <em>cicerone</em> (singular) and <em>ciceroni</em> (plural<em>)</em> do not appear among the Explorer’s “ Employments and Identifiers,” which are descriptors that in the <em>Dictionary</em> follow the names of around 15% of the travelers. Related terms do appear, however, such as “antiquarian” and “antiquary.” Through a combination of the “Employments and Identifiers” filter and the use of free searches for terms including “antiquarian,” “antiquary,” “<em>cicerone</em>,” and “tour guide,” I was able to compile a list of fifteen <em>ciceroni</em> (fig 1).</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"figure-1\"></a></p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><em>Cicerone</em></th>\n      <th>Clients identified (hover cursor to see names)</th>\n      <th>Number of clients identified</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Francesco de’ Ficoroni (1664–1747)</td>\n      <td><a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/29\" title=\"Joseph Addison\" target=\"\\_blank\">●</a> <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/292\" title=\"Hon.

Table of clients&rsquo; characteristics. In this table travelers are represented by various categories devised by the author in exploring the data. There are twenty-five distinct categories ranging from types of professions, places of education, nationalities, counts of women, status, whether touring with families or groups or individually, and society affiliations. The number of travelers for each category appears both by relevant <i>cicerone</i> and as a total. The total in parentheses indicates the actual number of clients.  As discussed in the essay, seven clients toured with two different <i>ciceroni</i>, so in some cases they were counted twice in the same category in the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; total.\n\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h1 id=\"the-ciceroni\">The <em>Ciceroni</em></h1>\n\n<p>All but one of the <em>ciceroni</em> on my list worked in Rome, the exception being <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/952\">James Clark</a> (c. 1754–1800, travel years 1768–1800), who was a guide in Naples. With its unique abundance of monuments, Rome was a place where tours were especially desirable. As the seat of the Jacobite court in exile, it was home to many British Catholics; a number of the <em>ciceroni</em> on my list were Scottish Jacobites or sympathizers. British guides usually had traveled to Rome to study painting, less often sculpture or architecture, but may not have been so successful in those professions and, at any rate, developed a great interest in antiquities and cultivated their knowledge of them.</p>\n\n<p>The first known <em>cicerone</em> of the eighteenth century appears to have been an Italian, Francesco de’ Ficoroni (1664–1747). A native of Lazio, Ficoroni was the most sought-after antiquarian in Rome from 1690 to 1745. In addition to working as a <em>cicerone</em>, overseeing excavations, and publishing his scholarship, he collected and dealt in antiquities, as did many antiquarians, connoisseurs, scholars, and tour guides. As Tamara Griggs has demonstrated, Ficoroni’s contribution to guiding was to adapt the Roman tradition of antiquarianism to the interests of Grand Tourists.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In his <em>Osservazioni di Francesco de’ Ficoroni sopra l’antichità di Roma</em> of 1709, Ficoroni listed an array of aristocratic clients whom he had led around Rome, particularly the catacombs, evidence that the services of <em>ciceroni</em> were already popular at the beginning of the eighteenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> His clients hailed not only from Britain but also from France, Sweden, Denmark, Flanders, Holland, and Germany. Did Ficoroni speak to them in Italian? In the seventeenth century, Italian was an international language of diplomacy and music; travelers may have had some knowledge of it, but how many could have fully understood it and conversed in it? This factor may partly account for the popularity of British <em>ciceroni</em> among a tourist population dominated by Britons. Nonetheless, Ficoroni’s first recorded client was the well-known British politician and writer <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/29\">Joseph Addison</a> (1672–1719, travel years 1700–1701), who is documented to have been the first to use the term <em>ciceroni</em> in 1726.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>A later Italian <em>cicerone</em> was Ridolfino Venuti (1705–63), a highly respected scholar who was appointed <em>Commissario delle Antichità</em> (Prefect of Papal Antiquities) in 1744.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> One of the duties of the papal antiquarian was to guide important visitors around Rome, but according to Venuti’s famous successor in the post, Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Venuti was unable to live on his salary of 180 <em>scudi</em> per annum and took on other wealthy travelers as clients to supplement his income, a practice that apparently proved quite lucrative. Winckelmann succeeded Venuti in 1763, the only non-Italian to ever hold the position, an indication of the esteem in which the German antiquarian was held.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> He did not share his predecessor’s interest in escorting travelers around Rome, especially the British and the French, whom he respectively regarded as humorless and frivolous. He was, of course, more tolerant of Germans, especially Prince Leopold III of Anhalt-Dessau, whom he described as a “German Achilles.” Winckelmann’s tours, as we will see, reflected his idiosyncratic perspective on ancient art.</p>\n\n<p>Venuti also supplemented his income by writing guidebooks. He wrote two about Rome, one published in 1763 and the other in 1766, the first on antiquities and the second on modern sights, including collections of antiquities.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> Venuti’s guidebooks are detailed and scholarly, catering to a broader audience of Grand Tourists; in 1762, he also had published a well-illustrated book on the most beautiful <em>vedute</em> (views or prospects) in Italy, written simultaneously in English, French, and Italian.<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The first known British <em>cicerone</em> of the eighteenth century, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3734\">Mark Parker</a> (c. 1698–1775, travel years from birth to 1749), was born in Florence to a British <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3734.1\">father</a> and a German <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3734.2\">mother</a> and raised a Catholic. He entered the service of the pope as captain of the papal galleys but was also well known among British tourists as an antiquarian in Rome. Eventually denounced by the Jacobites as a Hanoverian spy, Parker was banished by the Inquisition in 1749 and ultimately settled in Paris. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3732\">John Parker</a> (fl. 1740, d. 1765, travel years 1740?–c. 1762), an unsuccessful history painter unrelated to Mark, attempted to succeed him as a <em>cicerone</em> but failed, no doubt partly owing to his quarrelsome nature. It was <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4179\">James Russel</a> (c. 1720–63, travel years in Italy 1740–63) who, despite being exposed as a Jacobite by John Parker, his rival for the succession, eventually followed Mark Parker as <em>cicerone</em> to the British.<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> Russel was indeed a Jacobite, from a family staunchly of that persuasion, and was rigorously educated in the classics, which nourished the growth of his antiquarian interests in Rome. He went there to study painting, which he did at the French Academy, and achieved moderate success as an artist, mostly in copying famous works for tourists. He also served as an agent for other artists. His best-known painting is a so-called conversation piece, set in a Roman interior, in which he pictured himself with tourists who were fellow Jacobites, wearing a tartan coat to show his sympathy for the Stuart cause (fig. 3).<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../paul-figure-3.png\" id=\"fig3\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap3\">\n\nFig. 3.

Both from Scotland, they studied in Rome with the famed neoclassical painter Anton Raphael Mengs. Morison, highly regarded as an antiquarian, also worked as a dealer, excavator, and artist.<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> Byres, a Catholic and the son of committed Jacobites, was most active as a <em>cicerone</em> but was a knowledgeable antiquarian, as well, and worked as an architect and dealer, particularly of modern paintings, small figures, and decorative furnishings.<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> Byres and Morison were both collectors, and although they were in a sense rivals and were each described at times as temperamental, they seem to have lodged together amicably near the Piazza di Spagna between 1762 and 1765. Byres returned to his family estates in Scotland in 1790, but Morison lived in Rome until his death in 1810.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3610\">Christopher Norton</a> (c. 1740–99, travel years 1760–90), an engraver and antiquarian, began working as a <em>cicerone</em> under <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">Byres</a>.<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup> According to Thomas Egerton, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2121\">Baron Grey de Wilton</a> (1749–1814, travel years 1785, 1788), who toured with Byres in 1785, Norton stood in for Byres when the former was not well. Norton solidified the association by marrying Byres’s niece, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3748.1\">Janet Moir</a>, in 1792. By that time Byres’s nephew and Janet’s cousin, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3364\">Patrick Moir</a> (1769–1810, travel years 1785–1805), himself a respected antiquarian who had already been living with his uncle, took over Byres’s business as a <em>cicerone</em> and dealer.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> Norton lived until 1799, and Moir stayed in Rome until 1805, both carrying on in the tradition of Byres.</p>\n\n<p>As these examples show, leading tours was one of a constellation of activities in which antiquarians and connoisseurs, many of whom were also artists, participated in Rome. Only some of the <em>ciceroni</em> cited here—those who were able to establish a large and steady clientele—may have considered guiding tours a primary career and source of income. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4179\">Russel</a>, for instance, worked both as an artist and tour guide. In a letter of 1753 to a fellow client of Russel, the scholar <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4469\">Joseph Spence</a> (1699–1768, travel years 1731–33, 1739–41) wrote, “There are so many rivals in Painting, that if our friend Russel can get the English at Rome as sole <em>cicerone</em>, it may possibly prove the more beneficial profession.”<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup> Indeed, Russel’s work as a tour guide ultimately took precedence over his artistic pursuits.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes <em>ciceroni</em> traveled with their clients, but they might have found it more lucrative to remain at the site of business. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3436\">Morison</a>, for example, accompanied <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1718\">James Ogilvy, 7th and 4th Earl of Findlater and Seafield</a> (1750–1811, travel years 1771–73), in Europe and northern Italy but charged him £600 to make up for income he forfeited by leaving Rome. Roman <em>ciceroni</em> did, however, lead tours in nearby towns with popular sights; for instance, in 1777 <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">James Byres</a> guided a party of three in Tivoli, Albani, and Frascati (see the <a href=\"https://purl.stanford.edu/xq968jc6853\">data behind this essay</a>). Other kinds of work that <em>ciceroni</em> did, such as writing guidebooks, making copies, and collecting and dealing, including procuring export licenses, also participated in the economy of the Grand Tour.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Travelers, for their part, came to expect these services, while guides profited, sometimes shamelessly, through duplicitous or shady practices. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2680\">Thomas Jenkins</a> (1722–98, travel years 1751–98), for example, would overcharge unwitting clients and pass off modern objects made under his supervision, such as cameos, as antiques.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> Others bought artworks, either ancient or modern, and arranged for them to be exported without procuring the requisite licenses from the papal antiquarian, who controlled their issuance.<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup> <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">Byres</a>, for instance, secretly negotiated for the Boccapaduli family to sell their coveted series of paintings of the seven sacraments by the great seventeenth-century French artist Nicolas Poussin to the Duke of Rutland.<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> These celebrated pictures were such a tourist attraction, however, that they were replaced with copies, which Byres then passed off as the originals. Similarly, Ficoroni failed to inform the papal antiquarian of a work he had acquired through an excavation—an antique porphyry head that he had bought “from certain masons who had found it in a dig”—and was put on trial and fined.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-clients\">The Clients</h1>\n\n<p>The Explorer was essential for identifying the clients of <em>ciceroni</em>, as many as 135 (see <a href=\"/scholars-essays/paul-ciceroni-and-their-clients#figure-1\">fig. 1</a>). Most of these (121) appear in the Explorer, usually with an entry under their own name but sometimes under another, such as that of a traveling companion. Other travelers who toured with <em>ciceroni</em> were identified in the Explorer, but because their guides were not named, they don’t appear on the client list. As would be expected, the information in the Explorer was most complete for British clients. No clients were found, however, for Venuti, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3732\">John Parker</a>, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3049\">Andrew Lumisden</a> (1720–1801, travel years 1749–69), <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3769\">William Patoun</a> (fl. 1761, d. 1783, travel years 1761–63, 1763–64, 1768–69, 1773–74, 1775–76), or <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2065\">Abbé Peter Grant</a> (1708–84, travel years 1726–35, 1737–84), even though the last, a Jesuit priest and antiquarian, was regarded as “something of an institution” among Grand Tourists. Patoun seems to have worked more as a bear leader than a <em>cicerone</em>; a few of his charges appear in the Explorer. In 1775, he accompanied one of them, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3957\">George Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis</a>, on a tour conducted by <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">James Byres</a>.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> It is hard—maybe impossible—to know how many more travelers than those I have identified were guided by <em>ciceroni</em>, which should be kept in mind in considering the information presented here.</p>\n\n<p>Most of Ficoroni’s clients, whom he listed in his own publication, appear in the Explorer. Thus, although there is no entry for the Italian <em>cicerone</em> himself, his importance as a guide and antiquarian emerges from the Explorer.<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> Among his British clients were <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/29\">Addison</a>, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4469\">Spence</a>, and the well-known bear leader <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2321\">Dr. James Hay</a> (d. 1746, travel years 1704–6, 1707–9, 1711–12, 1715, 1718–19, 1720, 1722–23, 1729–34), who toured with his charge, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/291\">Benjamin Bathurst</a> (c. 1691–1767, travel years 1711–12). Unlike most later <em>ciceroni</em>, Ficoroni also had clients from various other European countries.<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> The Explorer was similarly helpful in identifying clients for Winckelmann, who does not have an entry either.<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> In addition to aristocratic Britons, Winckelmann’s clientele included the politician <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5119\">John Wilkes</a> (1725–97, travel year 1765), the writer <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4528\">Laurence Sterne</a> (1713–68, travel years 1765–66), and some of his own countrymen, such as the Duke of Braunschweig.<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The first three clients listed for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3734\">Mark Parker</a>, all British noblemen, toured as a group with him in 1740. One of them, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1302\">Francis Dashwood</a> (1708–81, travel years 1730–31, 1739–40), was a founding member of the Society of Dilettanti, which another, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4037\">John Rawdon</a> (1720–93, travel years 1739–40), joined in 1741. The aristocratic British writer <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4974\">Horace Walpole</a> (1717–97, travel years 1739–41) famously described the Dilettanti as “a club, for which the nominal qualification is having been in Italy and the real one being drunk; the two chiefs are <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3305\">Lord Middlesex</a> and Sir Francis Dashwood, who were seldom sober the whole time they were in Italy.”<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup> Nonetheless, the Dilettanti made significant cultural contributions later in the century.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> Touring with Dashwood and Rawdon was <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3552\">Roger Newdigate</a> (1719–1806, travel years 1739–40, 1774–75), a draftsman and amateur architect who wrote an important account of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence during his travels.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> Among Mark Parker’s clients was also <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3919.1\">Henrietta Louisa Jeffreys Fermor, Countess of Pomfret</a> (c. 1700–1761, travel years 1739–41), the first woman we know to have toured with a <em>cicerone</em>.</p>\n\n<p>A number of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4179\">Russel</a>’s clients appear in the Explorer, too, as well as the brothers <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/859\">Lord George Augustus Cavendish</a> (c. 1727–94, travel years 1749–50) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/858\">Lord Frederick Cavendish</a> (1729–1803, travel years 1749–50), who were forced to cancel their tour at the last minute after the tutor accompanying them, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3033\">Dr. Robert Lowth</a> (1710–87, travel years 1749–50), spilled scalding water on his leg and was incapacitated for six weeks. The Explorer also reveals that <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/952\">Clark</a>, the major <em>cicerone</em> of Naples, sometimes served as a guide for the same clients led by <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3436\">Morison</a> (<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3935\">Porter</a> and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4163\">Rowley</a>) or <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">Byres</a> (<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/611\">Brooke</a> and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3741\">Parkinson</a>, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2121\">Egerton</a> and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1823\">Foxley</a>) in Rome, supporting the notion that <em>ciceroni</em> tended to establish their businesses in particular cities and stay there. I found only one traveler, however, who toured with two different <em>ciceroni</em> in the same city: in Rome, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/324\">Elizabeth Berkeley, Duchess of Beaufort</a> (1719–99, travel years 1771–74), visited the Colonna Palace with <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2680\">Jenkins</a> in 1773 and St. Peter’s Basilica with Byres in 1774.</p>\n\n<p>The Explorer confirms that <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3436\">Morison</a> and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">Byres</a> were two of the most popular guides of their day. Nonetheless, one <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/553\">Thomas Brand</a> (c. 1717–70, travel years 1738–39, 1754–55) commented that Morison and his client, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1159\">George Coussmaker</a> (1759–1802, travel years 1783–84), “were like ‘a hen with a single chicken,’ while James Byres escorted a party of seven at the same time.” Indeed, Byres had by far the most clients on my list—fifty, including a party of seven in 1784—while Morison is most well known as the <em>cicerone</em> of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/509\">James Boswell</a> (1740–95, travel year 1765), biographer of the writer Samuel Johnson. Capitalizing on their positions, Morison and Byres sometimes acted as agents or dealers for those they guided, Morison for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2445\">Richard Colt Hoare</a> (1758–1838, travel years 1785–87, 1788–91) and Byres for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5279\">Philip Yorke</a> (1757–1834, travel years 1778–79), but clients of one <em>cicerone</em> sometimes used another for that purpose, too.</p>\n\n<p>What can be gleaned from the biographical information for clients derived from the Explorer (see <a href=\"/scholars-essays/paul-ciceroni-and-their-clients#figure-2\">fig. 2</a>)? To begin with professions, including future careers, we can see that statesmen top the list by more than thirty, with writers and scholars together and military officers second and third. As for university, the largest number of clients went to Oxford, then to Cambridge by little more than half the amount, with Eton and Westminster the most popular schools. My survey of groups, women, and families indicates that a number of clients toured together. Clients toured with traveling companions, bear leaders, tutors, governors, and their families and were occasionally paired with strangers. I was not surprised to find that a large number of clients were titled or royal, though less than half of all, but I did expect there to be more Catholics, the church and its art and architecture being one of the major attractions of travel to Italy.</p>\n\n<p>I was a bit surprised that so few of the clients I tracked became members of learned societies, especially the Dilettanti, the existence of which was predicated on the Grand Tour. Nor did many clients become important patrons of the arts like <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3013\">Charles Long</a> (1760–1838, travel years 1786–88), who was a trustee of both the British Museum and the National Gallery, or the <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3919.1\">Countess of Pomfret</a>, who donated a collection of ancient sculpture to the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> But some American colonists in a tour group that was guided by <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">Byres</a> returned to play significant roles in their fledgling country.<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup> Two were prominent Philadelphians, and two were from Boston; on their tour in 1764, they probably would have considered themselves Britons. Three proved loyal to the colonies; only one, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3714\">Thomas Palmer</a> (1743–1820, travel year 1764), left America in 1776. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3429\">Dr. John Morgan</a> (1735–89, travel year 1764), a prominent physician, returned to Philadelphia to found the American Philosophical Society, and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3953\">Samuel Powel</a> (d. 1793, travel year 1764), both the last colonial and the first postcolonial mayor of Philadelphia, joined the society.</p>\n\n<p>My client list mentions a few travelers who guided their companions but were not themselves professional <em>ciceroni</em>, such as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2437\">John Coxe Hippisley</a> (1747–1825, travel years 1779–1780, 1793–95, 1818), later a baronet, who guided <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2363\">George Augustus Herbert, Lord Herbert</a> (1759–1827, travel years 1779–80) in Rome in 1779, though Herbert had engaged <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/952\">Clark</a> in Naples. Some artists and scholars took visitors sightseeing on occasion. The painter and antiquarian <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2207\">Gavin Hamilton</a> (1723–98, travel years 1748–50, 1756–98), for example, led a party of tourists to see his excavations at the site of the ancient city of Gabii, outside of Rome.<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> Similarly, the great German writer Johann Wolfgang Goethe noted in his Grand Tour journal that his countryman, Johann Friedrich Reiffenstein, an antiquarian and artist who lived in Rome, sometimes showed visitors around the city and planned activities for them.<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The Explorer also references <em>ciceroni</em> other than those on my list, but most are otherwise unknown, even if named. Among those named are Britons and a few Italians, some of whom worked in cities other than Rome and Naples: a Pietro Paolo Pizoli in Bologna, for example, and an Abbé Pilori in Florence. Clients’ comments make clear that elite <em>ciceroni</em> competed with shady or less qualified ones. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2363\">Herbert</a> noted that one Raphaeli, a <em>cicerone</em> in Naples, stole things. According to Johann Jakob Volkmann, a well-educated German who toured with Winckelmann, “Most of these antiquaries are abbots [<em>abate</em> was an honorific title for a cassock-clad layman] who work in the field as manual laborers. Without possessing science or taste, they learn their routine by heart . . . baptize the statues according to their will, and give false names to the pictures. Most of the pieces are called <em>cose stupende</em> [stupendous things] with no discrimination, but they can very seldom conduct the art lover to true beauty and to the building of his taste,” which was Winckelmann’s goal.<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup> Similarly, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/167\">George Edward Ayscough</a> (d. 1779, travel year 1770), a soldier and dramatist, described the <em>ciceroni</em> of Rome as “a set of scurvy abbati’s [sic] to whom foreigners pay a settled salary, and give constant place at their table, to be led about like bears by these <em>learned</em> [his italics] gentlemen . . . whose interest it is never to let him leave Rome while he can show him a broken pillar, a mutilated statue, or a single classical vestige of any kind whatever.”</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-tours\">The Tours</h1>\n\n<p>What were the tours led by elite <em>ciceroni</em> like, and what were their clients’ experiences? By the late eighteenth century, these tours must have been fairly standardized, though my research confirmed that they could vary in length, the sights that were seen, and the amount of time spent touring each day. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3413\">John Moore</a> (1729–1802, travel years 1775–76), a physician and writer who visited Rome in 1775–76 in the company of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2203\">Douglas Hamilton, the 8th Duke of Hamilton</a> (1756–99, travel years 1775–76), described his tour in the account he wrote of his travels: “What is called a regular course with an Antiquarian, generally takes up about six weeks; employing three hours a day, you may, in that time, visit all the churches, palaces, villas, and ruins worth seeing, in or near Rome. . . . There are about thirty palaces in Rome, as full of pictures as the walls can bear. . . . There are also ten or twelve villas in the neighborhood of this city, which are usually visited by strangers.”<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup> Winckelmann’s excursions reportedly lasted more than three hours a day, extending from nine in the morning until three or four in the afternoon.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">Byres</a> and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3436\">Morison</a> expected twenty sequins (<em>zecchini</em>) for a course “and thirty if two companions.”<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup> When Byres handed his business over to Moir, however, the uncle advised his nephew to charge £50 or £100 per person and recommended that parties should comprise “five or not more than seven.” He further noted that select travelers should be entertained with “a Hansom Breakfast, Dinner or Supper.” According to <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3769\">Patoun</a>, <em>ciceroni</em>, not their clients, should also pay “the servants who shew the palaces.”<sup id=\"fnref:40\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></sup> He suggested three pauls for a small palace, five for a larger one, and half a sequin for the Colonna and Barberini palaces. Who were the servants to whom Patoun was referring? Did they give tours of the palaces or merely provide access? One possibility is that they were high-ranking servants who cared for the household property of elites, some of whom acted as advisers, agents, or curators for their employers’ collections.<sup id=\"fnref:41\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In preparation for touring, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3769\">Patoun</a> advised travelers to read Venuti’s guidebook to Roman antiquities, recommending “the Night before the Chapter . . . that describes the quarter or particular Piece of Antiquity which you are to see with your Antiquarian the day following. By this means you will go informed to a great degree, and of course perceive clearer Ideas, and be more able to make proper questions, when any doubt arises.”<sup id=\"fnref:42\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></sup> Similarly, Winckelmann noted that tourists were ill prepared for sightseeing and planned to write a guidebook for Germans to read before departing their homeland.<sup id=\"fnref:43\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The quality of the tour would have depended of course on the quality of the guide. As I have suggested, many tours were probably not like those given by the elite <em>ciceroni</em> on my list. Moreover, there is not a great deal of information on the more elite tours and the relative merits of their guides, and some of it is contradictory. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3769\">Patoun</a> said that “Morisson is esteemed the best Medallist &amp; Classic Scholar, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">Byres</a> the most agreable &amp; communicative. . . . They are both Originally Painters, and of course know the Pictures as well as the Antiquities,” which was an important qualification. “Having a regard for both, I cannot recommend one in preference to the other.”<sup id=\"fnref:44\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></sup> Clients, however, complained that both these <em>ciceroni</em> were given to moodiness and pedantry.<sup id=\"fnref:45\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>More seems to be known about <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">Byres</a>’s tours than those of others, thanks to the survival of descriptions by clients. Apparently Byres had no fixed itinerary but determined his course by the weather, “antiquities and ruins when fine, statues and palaces when wet,” and pictures on clear but unpleasantly windy days. The four American clients mentioned above took a three-week course with Byres in the spring of 1764 (the recommended season); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3953\">Powel</a> and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3429\">Morgan</a> kept notes on what they saw in Rome.<sup id=\"fnref:46\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></sup> Most such courses began with a visit to the Capitoline Hill, as did <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/509\">Boswell</a>’s tour with <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3436\">Morison</a>; there the <em>cicerone</em> would point out the seven hills and principal sights of antiquity.<sup id=\"fnref:47\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></sup> Powel and Morgan, however, started with the Vatican Palace and St. Peter’s Basilica, spending four days there in all. During the rest of the week they visited the Villa Farnesina and the Palazzo Farnese, as well as other palaces. They also heard a papal mass at the Oratorian church of S. Maria in Vallicella, called the Chiesa Nuova (new church).</p>\n\n<p>In the second week of their tour, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3953\">Powel</a> and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3429\">Morgan</a> focused on seeing collections in palaces and stopped at various churches along their way. On the weekend, they visited the Capitoline Hill and its buildings, including the museum, the basilica of S. Paolo Fuori le Mura (St. Paul Outside the Walls), and the Villa Albani. The final week of Powel and Morgan’s tour began with a trip to the Colosseum and included the Baths of Titus and Trajan, more palaces, and the Villa Borghese. On the last day, they were “presented to His Holiness.” This course seems to have been somewhat light on the antiquities—they didn’t go to the forum, for instance—which may have reflected the weather conditions or the preferences of the clients, as their tour was rather short.</p>\n\n<p>In educating his charges, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">Byres</a> displayed his antiquarian and connoisseurial skills, explaining the historical and literary contexts of ancient monuments and sites and appraising the quality of both antiquities and early modern paintings, as was appropriate to the understanding of these works in the eighteenth century. Although his courses were sometimes described as dry or dull, he would interject amusing anecdotes. For example, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3953\">Powel</a> wrote in his notes that the bare-shouldered figure of “Justice” (actually <em>Truth</em>) on Gianlorenzo Bernini’s tomb of Alexander the VII in St. Peter’s was “so admirable that it caused a Workman to attempt to enjoy her, after which the Pope caused a Drapery of Brass to be put over the Body.”<sup id=\"fnref:48\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:48\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></sup> The story is apocryphal, of course, but it points up Byres’s classicizing taste and demonstrates how <em>cicerone</em> could mediate their clients’ experiences through their own preferences. If Byres disliked Bernini’s unrestrained baroque style, he might have objected even more to Caravaggio’s unidealized naturalism, for it seems that he didn’t show his clients the artist’s great paintings of St. Matthew in the Contarelli chapel when they visited the church of S. Luigi dei Francesi.<sup id=\"fnref:49\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:49\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></sup> Byres’s taste may have been influenced by that of Mengs, his teacher, but even Mengs was less rigid; the <em>cicerone</em>’s preferences rather harken back to the strict standards espoused by the antiquarian and critic Giovanni Pietro Bellori in the later seventeenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:50\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:50\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">50</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Winckelmann shared <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">Byres</a>’s neoclassical taste, though his tours were reportedly livelier. Volkmann, who visited the Vatican Palace with Winckelmann, described the reaction to his <em>cicerone</em>’s enthusiastic commentaries: “The papal guards stood there with open mouths completely astonished and maybe thought that malaria had disturbed his brains.”<sup id=\"fnref:51\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:51\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></sup> Winckelmann had been reading to Volkmann from his manuscripts on some of the antiquities, such as the <em>Apollo Belvedere</em>. His comments must have been like the rhapsodic passage on that statue in one of his later publications: “My chest seems to expand with veneration and to heave like those I have seen swollen as if by the spirit of prophecy, and I feel myself transported to Delos and to the Lycian groves, places Apollo honored with his presence.”<sup id=\"fnref:52\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Winckelmann’s dramatic responses to ancient statuary, which he hoped to cultivate in others, seem to have remained unique among <em>ciceroni</em> but not tourists. Roman antiquities had sparked the imaginations of travelers long before the eighteenth century; the reactions of Grand Tourists, especially Britons, are particularly distinguished by their excited visualizations of the distant past. Educated in the classics, many of these travelers were routinely prompted by the material remains of antiquity to imagine the ancient world, enthusiastically reconstructing it in their minds through historical and literary association.<sup id=\"fnref:53\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:53\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></sup> Indeed, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3049\">Lumisden</a> noted in the guide he wrote to Rome that “on the spot we read them [the classics] with an additional enthusiasm.”<sup id=\"fnref:54\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:54\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">54</a></sup> Thus the historian <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1935\">Edward Gibbon</a> (1737–94, travel years 1764–65) recalled the beginning of his Roman tour with <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/747\">Byres</a>, which inspired him to write his famous history of Rome:</p>\n\n<blockquote>My temper is not very susceptible of enthusiasm, and the enthusiasm which I do not feel I have ever scorned to affect. But at the distance of twenty-five years, I can neither forget nor express the strong emotions which agitated my mind as I first approached and entered the eternal City. After a sleepless night, I trod, with a lofty step, the ruins of the Forum; each memorable spot where Romulus stood, or Tully spoke, or Caesar fell, was at once present to my eye; and several days of intoxication were lost or enjoyed before I could descend to a cool and minute investigation.<span><sup id=\"fnref:55\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:55\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">55</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, when <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/509\">Boswell</a> visited the Palatine hill with <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3436\">Morison</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>We walked to where the house of Cicero had stood. A statue there resembles him a great deal. Struck by these famous places, I was seized with enthusiasm. I began to speak Latin. Mr. Morison replied. He laughed a bit at the beginning. But we made a resolution to speak Latin continually during this course of antiquities. We have persisted, and every day we speak with greater facility, so that we have harangued on Roman antiquities in the language of the Romans themselves.<span><sup id=\"fnref:56\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:56\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">56</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>Despite its playfulness, this episode illustrates the imaginative depth of the experience possible for tourists, even if <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/509\">Boswell</a> had to lead his <em>cicerone</em>. Nonetheless, the professional guide—however changed since the eighteenth century—has become a fixture of modern travel, and that is the undeniable legacy of the <em>ciceroni</em> of the Grand Tour.</p>\n\n<div class=\"dataButton\" onclick=\"window.open('https://purl.stanford.edu/xq968jc6853','mywindow');\">Download and explore the data behind this essay</div>\n\n<h1 id=\"notes\">Notes</h1>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>John Evelyn, <em>The Diary of John Evelyn</em>, ed.

By transforming the rich and varied information of the original print entries into a multidimensional database, the Explorer re-animates the thousands of travelers that appear in the print <em>Dictionary</em>’s pages. Among other things, this process has centered hundreds of women who were previously subsumed under the headings of other travelers (by and large, men); foregrounded overlooked and otherwise “hidden” figures, such as servants; and made visible and quantifiable the unevenness of information preserved across this world of travelers.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"a-database-of-travelers\">A Database of Travelers</h1>\n\n<p>While the scholarly essays in the previous section constitute an exemplary subset, there are as many ways of working with the Explorer as there are research questions. This section, “Presenting the Data,” systematically presents and explains every facet of the categorizing process that led to the creation of the Explorer’s data, making explicit the choices involved. To turn historical information into data is to formalize and interpret it. Data is always constructed to varying degrees, such that it is crucial to cultivate an awareness of both its provenance and its construction. Joanna Drucker, Miriam Posner, and Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein have all emphasized the importance of data construction and editing, and Claire Lemercier and Claire Zalc have recently written that “building data from sources and creating categories that do not erase all complications is not just the longest and most complicated stage of research; it is also the most interesting.”<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> It is vital to understand not merely what the data in the Explorer represents and means but how its representation and meaning relate to its construction and its sources.</p>\n\n<p>The principle of connecting data documentation to data presentation is important in two senses. First, to be transparent about this process is to acknowledge the labor that went into it and to guarantee the documentation essential to preserve it. The semistructured nature of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s biographical and travel information facilitated a systematic approach. The consistent use of abbreviations for certain life events and for certain movements of the travelers enabled a computational parsing of these as regular expressions. But this parsing was always guided by specific and carefully thought-out decisions about which categories to use and how to name them, how to resolve ambiguities, what to include, and what and how to count. Each of these decisions, in turn, directed the parsing work in its several iterations, the results of which ultimately constituted the data and its structure. The process itself imbued the data with meaning and determined how it would be preserved and shared. It entailed making decisions about a range of questions, including the organization of the temporal and spatial dimensions of historical information laced with uncertainty, the structuring and use of gender or occupational categories, and the translation of a large, complex, and dynamic database into static and easily downloadable tables.</p>\n\n<p>Second, to understand the construction of the data—its multiple categories and how they relate to one another—is to unlock new ways to do research, make arguments, and create knowledge. Christopher Warren, when writing about the data in his computational study of the <em>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em>, coined the phrase “historiography’s two voices” to distinguish between data serving as an index of the past as such and data serving as testimony to the <em>ODNB</em>’s own contingent making.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> The <em>Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy</em>, with its approximately six thousand lives, is by no means comparable in scale to the <em>ODNB</em>, with its circa sixty thousand. It is possible for a scholar to carefully read the <em>Dictionary</em> in its entirety, whereas it would take 137 years, as Warren reports, to read the entire <em>ODNB</em> at the rate of one life per day.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> But the two books share a risk when it comes to datafication—namely, that a data-driven approach would merely illuminate the reference work itself. To push beyond this requires careful and self-conscious handling of the data and open-minded exploration of the intersections between its various dimensions.</p>\n\n<center><h2>* * *</h2></center>\n\n<p>The <em>Dictionary</em> also differs from the <em>ODNB</em>—which is dedicated to “significant, influential or notorious figures”—in its inclusion of people about whom not much is known.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> This is a remarkable achievement and offers researchers a rare opportunity, which digital technology facilitates but that relies conceptually and materially on a long tradition of work. Already in 1979, in their famous article “Il nome e il come,” Carlo Ginzburg and Carlo Poni intervened on the divide between microhistory and quantitative history with a proposal to combine prosopography with nonelite history. They advocate for tracing a name across archives as a way to bridge the gap between lived experiences and larger dynamics.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> This bridging of multiple archives is precisely what the <em>Dictionary</em>’s many authors have done, from Brinsley Ford to Ingamells to their collaborators. The <em>Dictionary</em>’s entries meticulously reconstruct piecemeal attestations found in assorted archives and other primary and secondary sources, offering consideration to the possible, fragmentary, and often otherwise-unknown lives of the tourists. In doing so, the entries reconstruct an expansive picture of the Grand Tour that includes lesser-known travelers alongside the famous ones, providing a breadth that is more fully realized with the creation of over a thousand additional entries in the Explorer.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that there are <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22entry%22:%7B%22terms%22:%5B%7B%22value%22:%22probably%22,%22beginning%22:true,%22end%22:true%7D,%7B%22value%22:%22possibly%22,%22beginning%22:true,%22end%22:true%7D%5D,%22sections%22:%5B%7B%22key%22:%22biography%22,%22name%22:%22Biography%22,%22checked%22:true,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12429%22%7D,%7B%22key%22:%22narrative%22,%22name%22:%22Narrative%22,%22checked%22:false,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12430%22%7D,%7B%22key%22:%22tours%22,%22name%22:%22Tours%22,%22checked%22:false,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12431%22%7D,%7B%22key%22:%22notes%22,%22name%22:%22Notes%22,%22checked%22:false,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12432%22%7D%5D,%22operator%22:%22or%22%7D%7D\">177</a> names in the <em>Dictionary</em> followed by the words <em>possibly</em> or <em>probably</em> lays bare this painstaking work of identification and underscores the many instances that lack secure confirmation. The Explorer’s subsequent datafication of the <em>Dictionary</em> takes this multidimensional tracking and identification of names (and even of those who are unnamed) even further. <em>A World Made by Travel</em> aligns with other digital projects dedicated to the recovery and preservation of more lives than could easily be handled as data in the analog past, offering the ability to move across hundreds or even thousands of biographical records, from individuals to subgroups to the whole.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> Expanded and digital prosopographies can yield significant insights precisely because they can be interrogated along multiple dimensions and at various scales. They don’t just operate at a close or distant level but along other axes: the aggregate, the visible, the uncertain, and the unknown. But remembering that these traces of past lives were <em>not</em> born digital should be part and parcel of any effort to preserve and understand them. No historical data set represents an exhaustive record of the past—nor does any archive—and working with the Explorer data requires understanding limits, as well as how to press on them for meaning, so as to return us to the archives with fresh eyes.</p>\n\n<p>A brief look at the data for the most numerous travelers among the “hidden figures”—the women—illustrates this point. Searching the Explorer by gender across the entire century covered by the <em>Dictionary</em> displays 955 women, less than 16 percent of the total number of travelers. But considering the year in which travelers set off on their tours creates a temporal distribution of women travelers across the century and shows that the number of women travelers increased both in absolute numbers and in proportion to male travelers over the course of the century (see fig. 1 and also <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled\">Rosemary Sweet’s analysis</a>). From just over one-tenth of the travelers in the 1710s, they come to represent between a quarter and a third of all travelers after 1790.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-4/figure-1.png\" id=\"fig1\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1\">\n\nFig. 1. Dot chart showing all Explorer entries distinguished by color for gender (female travelers in orange, male travelers in green, and travelers for whom gender data is not available in black) and grouped by decade of travel. One sees that the number of women travelers increased both in absolute numbers and in proportion to male travelers over the course of the century.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Adding another data point, that of age at the time of travel, brings further nuance. It is possible to calculate ages for 2,439 travelers for whom we have dates of birth. Overall, the youngest traveler’s age is zero and the maximum is eighty-five, but the average age is just under twenty (19.81). One can differentiate by gender as well: of the travelers with dates of birth, 267 are women (152 of whom are what I am calling “hidden figures,” newly identified for the Explorer).<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> The oldest (known) age for a female traveler is sixty-six, much younger than the oldest man. Does this difference mark a disparity in sampling or a meaningful pattern? Only drilling further into the data and looking at the stories of the oldest travelers will begin to offer an answer. Once the travelers whose ages are zero—that is, those born in Italy—are removed, the average age of travel goes much higher, both for women and for men: 28.5 and 28.1 years, respectively. The fact that the number of women and men recorded in the Explorer’s database as born in Italy is almost identical (forty-two and forty-six) confirms the representativeness of our data. But given the disparity in overall numbers for women and men—disparity both in absolute numbers and in the amount and type of information formalized across various dimensions within the database—one should look further into the data and, indeed, beyond the <em>Dictionary</em> to fully appreciate the meaning of the average age of travel for men and women.</p>\n\n<p>This brief dive into some the Explorer’s data counting and intersecting of categories also underscores how much understanding women’s presence in the Explorer data depends on peeling away layers, deciding what to include and how, and asking follow-up questions; for example, in this case, which letters, journals, and archives attest to women and births in Italy? This means working on both a granular and an aggregate level, looking for features pertaining to specific individuals while ascertaining broader trends. To come closer to the lived experience of the Grand Tour and furnish a fuller account of its female travelers requires the inclusion of more and more widely representative individuals, as well as the careful examination of multiple intersecting data dimensions.</p>\n\n<p>As Anna Geurts recently wrote, there has been a surge of studies in the past two decades that center on female travelers, with Dolan’s 2001 <em>Ladies of the Grand Tour</em> serving as a leading example.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> Geurts’s intervention is critical, calling into question these recent works’ positing of a typically female traveler’s gaze. Working with seven accounts from the 1790s, Geurts calls for a more sustained investigation of the diversity of women travelers’ motivations and experiences in relation to age, social status, and personal responsibility. This appreciation for the “irregular shapes and forms” of women’s tours can be expanded to many more women with multidimensional querying of the Explorer data. By combining gender, date of birth, and travel year data, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled\">Rosemary Sweet</a> has already shown that by the end of the century, women are more represented in the Explorer database than the young men who were traditionally understood to be the typical Grand Tourists. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/scholars-essays/sama-rosalba-carriera\">Catherine Sama</a>, while focusing on the Italian painter Rosalba Carriera’s networking with British travelers, detected a particular bond in her relationship with <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4047\">Katherine Read</a> (1723–78, travel years 1751–53) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/621.1\">Elizabeth Broughton</a> (d. 1734, travel years 1691–1734). The question of who counts as a traveler can be expanded by looking at the hundreds of women in the Explorer and distinguishing between those traveling with husbands or on their own, or with children and with parents. How to categorize someone like <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/398.1\">Anna Maria Collins</a> (d. 1763, travel years 1713–27), who was born in Italy to long-term residents but embarked on a reverse journey by marrying the traveler <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/398\">Willoughby Bertie</a> (1692–1760, travel years 1722–25/27) and moving with him to a post–Grand Tour life in England? As John Brewer urged us to ask, “Whose Grand Tour” was it? The sheer variety of female experiences in <em>A World Made by Travel</em> awaits further study.</p>\n\n<p>Going beyond the dichotomy of distant versus close reading, historical data research can operate at a range of scales in between dimensions, while holding space for outliers, too. Among the women travelers with the latest travel dates in the Explorer, making journeys at the close of the century, are <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1197\">Caroline Creighton</a> (1779–1856, travel years 1785–90) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/18.5\">Elizabeth Acton</a> (1806–47, travel years 1806–29), one born in Italy and the other born outside of Italy. Both women were also the subjects of portraits (see figs. 2 and 3), and it is moving to come face-to-face with them—especially given the disproportionate focus on men in typical Grand Tour portraiture—after surveying so many numbers, graphs, and dots.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-2\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-4/figure-2a.jpg\" id=\"fig2a\" onload=\"resize(this, getElementById(&apos;fig2b&apos;))\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig2b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap2&apos;))\" /> </a> <a name=\"figure-2\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-4/figure-2b.png\" id=\"fig2b\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig2a&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap2&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap2\">\n\nFigs. 2 and 3.

Understanding the data categories and their interconnections (including how they refer back to archival research) is essential for exploring the new prosopography of the Grand Tour that the Explorer enables.</p>\n\n<p>The complexity of each data categorization—and how the categories within each overlap, diverge, and interact with others—is best understood when presenting them individually, as is done below. But all work together structurally as depicted in the data schema in figure 4, which is a graphic representation of the organization of the data and of the relationships between dimensions. At the center is the main structuring principle of the data: the entry, marked by a unique identifier (the Entry ID number). Different colors distinguish different types of data connected to the entry: biographical data, travel data, and indexical data.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"/assets/images/ch-4/figure-4.svg\" id=\"fig4\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap4&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\nFig. 4. Data schema, a graphic representation of the organization of the data and the relationships between the different categories, starting with the foundational Entry ID.\n \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The data schema in figure 4 represents the full scope of the possible data categories that the database structure is designed to accommodate. But there is no single entry for which all the categories are populated, and how populated any one category is across the database varies greatly, as well. This has to do with uncertainty and gaps in the records, which—it bears repeating—are pervasive. Moreover, not all of the information available in the <em>Dictionary</em> was retrieved by the process of datafication. On the one hand, there were case-by-case decisions, such as the early choice not to capture aristocratic titles for which extensive data sets exist already. On the other hand, the omission of the category “unmarried” went unnoticed until it was too late. A category often pursued in prosopographical databases, that of nationality, was also left untouched. What the Explorer is meant to do by making all data available for download is to facilitate additions or transformations to its data structure. Understanding the formalization and categorization that went into creating the Explorer data is the necessary springboard to undertaking additional, specific types of formalization and interpretation down the line, according to whatever interests or questions researchers and readers bring to it.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The following sections treat each of the data categories that appears in the database, conveying how each category is built, how it is distributed across time or across the travelers’ entries of the database, and how it can interact with other categories. After sections about the foundational categories of Entry ID, entry origins, and gender, the following sections are grouped under the rubrics of “biographical data” (concerning the lives of travelers), “indexical data” (concerning the connections between entries by way of shared citations and shared mentions of people), and “travel data” (concerning the journeys of travelers). The thread of women travelers, particularly hidden figures, previously subsumed under other entries, is highlighted throughout, as this is the most significant change resulting from the transformation and augmentation the <em>Dictionary</em>’s printed words into the Explorer’s data.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"entry-id\">Entry ID</h1>\n\n<p>The Entry ID is a numeric data point expressing the unique identifier assigned to each traveler entry and connecting all data pertaining to it. The Entry ID remains constant throughout the database and its exported file formats. It is thanks to the Entry ID that one can confidently move across different fields, filters, and data categories in the Explorer and manipulate data from downloaded JSON or tabular files without losing track of which travelers are being considered.</p>\n\n<p>The data for Entry ID is complete, meaning that there is an Entry ID for each of the 6,007 entries. This is because the Entry ID is a value that was designated when the digital entries themselves were created during the course of the project. But the integer numbers for Entry IDs run only as high as 5,290 (some integer numbers are missing, and there are over a thousand Entry ID numbers with decimal points). These discrepancies bear marks of the <a href=\"/archive-to-explorer#paragraph-90\">longer story</a> of how the entries in the <em>Dictionary</em> were transformed into entries in the Explorer database. The total sum of entry headings identified by parsing in the original print <em>Dictionary</em> came to 5,290. But some of these were simply headings without body text, existing only as cross-references to other entries. The Entry IDs for these “empty” entry headings were deleted, leaving some integers missing (although the information these headings contained was preserved and formalized as <a href=\"/archive-to-explorer#paragraph-113\">alternate names</a>). Other integers that are missing are those originally assigned to <em>Dictionary</em> headings that turned out to refer to multiple travelers. These <a href=\"/archive-to-explorer#paragraph-114\">shared headings</a> were split into singular entries for each traveler, who was then assigned an individual decimal value appended to the original whole number Entry ID. For example, the <em>Dictionary</em>’s heading “Belscher, Mr and Mrs” and its corresponding Entry ID 354 were deleted; instead, the Explorer contains two headings and entries: “<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/354.1\">Mr Belscher</a>” is Entry ID 354.1, and “<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/354.2\">Mrs Belscher</a>” is Entry ID 354.2. Other decimal Entry IDs belong to <a href=\"gt-boo/archive-to-explorer#paragraph-116\">hidden figures</a>—that is, the travelers subsumed within another’s travel entry in the original <em>Dictionary</em> and lacking any heading of their own. For each of these, a new heading and Entry ID were created, the latter represented as a decimal value appended to the original entry’s ID. For example, the entry for the <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/318\">Hon. Aubrey Beauclerk</a> (1740–82, travel years 1778–81) spawned three additional entries: <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/318.1\">Catherine Ponsonby</a> (1742–89, travel years 1778–81), who was Beauclerk’s spouse; and their two daughters, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/318.2\">Catherine</a> (d. 1803, travel years 1778–81) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/318.3\">Caroline Beauclerk</a> (d. 1838, travel years 1778–81). The Entry IDs for these three women in the Explorer are 318.1, 318.2, and 318.3, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>But there are exceptions. The logic of the Explorer’s Entry ID is numerically progressive (just like the alphabetical one of the <em>Dictionary</em>). And it operates with the expectation of a one-to-one correlation between number of travelers and number of entries. This is why when new entries were created— when subdividing headings from the <em>Dictionary</em> that referenced multiple travelers, and when identifying additional travelers among the hidden figures subsumed in existing entries—their new Entry IDs were decimal numbers based on that of the original entry. There are two exceptions to keep in mind. First, a few decimal numbers resulted from a parsing mistake rather than through the intentional process of individuating travelers. During the initial computational “chunking” of the entries, a few headings were not recognized as separate, unrelated entries. These were then split and assigned individual decimal Entry IDs. But unlike the previously explained decimal Entry IDs where there is some connection between individuals who share the same ID number before the decimal point, these entries are unrelated save for this parsing error. By the time this became clear, it would have been too complicated to rerun the parsing correctly; so these remain with decimal Entry IDs in order to preserve their alphabetical order of appearance as in the original <em>Dictionary</em>. Second, some entries in the Explorer do not pertain to one individual traveler. Just like in the original <em>Dictionary</em>, these are instances when a single last name heading contains miscellaneous, sparse information: fragmented records of travelers with that surname at (more or less certain) given times in various locations. An example is the entry for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2019\">Gordon</a>, which contains sixteen tours, the first in 1704 and the last in 1797—but it is hard to believe that the Gordon who quarreled with a British painter in Rome in the summer of 1704, as reported in Shrewsbury’s journal, is the same who the Wynnes found very amiable in Florence in the summer of 1796, as reported in the Wynnes’ family diaries. The date span makes it unlikely that all these travel records belong to the same, singular traveler named Gordon. Because there is no other way to resolve this ambiguity with currently available information, these entries are maintained just as they were in the <em>Dictionary</em> in the hope that they will have future utility if additional knowledge emerges. (This is the same reason Sir Brinsley Ford and his collaborators included these cases in the archives and then the <em>Dictionary</em> originally.)</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"entry-origin\">Entry Origin</h1>\n\n<p>This string data point explains the origin of each digital entry, with three options: “From the <em>Dictionary</em>” indicates entries reproduced directly from the print <em>Dictionary</em>; “Extracted from heading” means newly created by dividing an entry whose heading in the print <em>Dictionary</em> included multiple travelers; and “Extracted from narrative” means newly created by retrieval from the narrative of another traveler’s entry (i.e., hidden figures). This information is variously expressed in words, graphic elements, and visualizations in the Explorer. The Entry Origin dot chart offers a general view across the whole data set showing whether the entries were newly created for the Explorer or already existed in the <em>Dictionary</em>. The decimal Entry ID number is a quick giveaway of newly created entries; moreover, in the Explorer’s individual entry pages, a newly created entry is recognizable by the fact that the traveler’s name appears in yellow instead of black (the standard color used for travelers from the original <em>Dictionary</em>’s headings). Just below the newly created traveler’s name, square brackets indicate the original heading from which the new entry was retrieved. For the newly created entries for hidden figures, the bracketed original heading has a link to the relative entry of origin. While entries for hidden figures contain no body text, an inset box explains the rationale for their creation: to bring visibility to previously subsumed travelers, as well as to highlight the act of recovery.</p>\n\n<p>This Entry Origin information is also available in the data downloaded from the Explorer, in the “Travelers” table under the column “origin.” In the case of entries for hidden figures, the adjacent column “originEntryID” gives the Entry ID of the travelers from whom the new entry was retrieved. The next column, “originEntryName,s” gives the original heading, in full, for the new entries created by the splitting of a multiple-person heading.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"gender\">Gender</h1>\n\n<p>This category tags each entry as string data: “female,” “male,” or “data not available.” This string data is complete in that it has been filled in for all 6,007 traveler entries. This is not surprising given that this is a category constructed and attributed in the course of formalizing the entries from the <em>Dictionary</em> into Explorer data. Completeness, however, does not equate to certainty or ease of categorization. Miriam Posner’s powerful words in 2015 about the crudity of gender binary categorization in data sets have resonated during the construction of the Explorer database and are only reinforced by the more recent writing of D’Ignazio and Klein in <em>Data Feminism</em> (2020).<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup> Much like D’Ignazio and Klein describe with regard to the binary gender categorization for the Colored Conventions Project, the reason for maintaining this categorization is the context of the records and the intention of the research, where a major priority has been to recover the women whose presence on the Grand Tour has long been obscured.<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> The records through which the erasures have taken place, from eighteenth-century archives and accounts to the headings of the <em>Dictionary</em>, counted gender as binary. This was a world in which women were not allowed many of the rights granted to men. The data itself shows this, for there are almost no records for women or their occupations and education. In this context, recovery happens by recounting the women.</p>\n\n<p>There remains a risk of missing records and misattributing categories in the data creation process. It is humbling to remember that it took four mistaken attributions, with the first four all being men, to establish Katherine Read as the painter of the conversation piece <em>British Gentlemen in Rome</em>, which opens <em>A World Made by Travel</em>. How many mistaken records are in the archives and reflected in subsequent readings of them? Careful counting is as hard now as it was then. The advantage of a structured database is that once it is downloaded, anyone can alter the categories as they wish, and I look forward to a future in which we will have more nuanced representations of gender identity for travelers in this data set.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"biographical-data\">Biographical Data</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"traveler-name\">Traveler Name</h2>\n\n<p>Travelers’ names in the database vary from cases of a single surname to multiple names, sometimes including titles and other terms. This is all string data. There are 6,598 records of names for 6,007 travelers. This discrepancy points to travelers with multiple recorded names, labeled in the database as “alternate names.” The original rationale for these alternate names is explained in the <em>Dictionary</em>’s “Note on Method” by Ingamells, who explains that entry headings register the traveler names at the time of their tour, while names acquired afterward through succession to family titles are listed as references on the pages where their alphabetical order places them.<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup> The print <em>Dictionary</em> contains 279 of these cases. In the Explorer database, these acquired names are recorded as alternate names for these travelers, all of whom are males. Ingamells’ “Note on Method” does not mention, however, the case of twelve women travelers who also possess distinct reference headings because of a marriage-related name change. Indeed, marriage is the reason for most of the remaining three hundred newly created alternate names records in the Explorer data. All but seven of these relate to women travelers recovered as hidden figures from under the heading of their husbands’ entries; for these women, both their maiden and their married names are recorded.<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> In the Explorer, all names, including alternate names, can be searched in the “traveler name” field. When downloading the data, the main names are recorded in the “name” column that appears in all three tables—to make it easier to know which travelers are being viewed—while alternate names are listed in their own column solely in the table “Travelers,” which is dedicated to basic biographical data.</p>\n\n<p>The inclusion of alternate names within the Explorer data structure is facilitated by Entry ID numbers, the organizing principle that identifies and distinguishes among travelers and their data. Entry IDs also allow inclusion of travelers who are all but nameless. Unlike alternate names, these are cases of information scarcity and uncertainty. In lieu of a name, only descriptors identifying a person are preserved, such as someone’s father being described as “a tailor from London,” or another only as their parent’s child, “son of x.” The recovery of hidden figures is accompanied by many such instances in which these descriptors populate the database as name data.</p>\n\n<p>Names are another area where historical information is often uncertain, inconsistent, and incomplete. In the print <em>Dictionary</em>, there is a sole case of an additional reference heading pointing to such uncertainty, when “Britton” is given as an alternative for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/567\">Bretton</a>. Reading through the entries, though, reveals many similar cases of misspelling or alternate names in the records from which the <em>Dictionary</em> was created, even if they failed to originally generate alternative headings. Several entries in the <em>Dictionary</em> explicitly mention such inconsistencies in the sources; many are due to Italian officials mishandling foreign names, but others also occur in British traveler accounts. These cases, together with the many instances of “possibly” and “probably” that accompany the <em>Dictionary</em>’s names, are reminders of the difficult and painstaking work of identification conducted by the researchers creating the <em>Dictionary</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Other cases indicate intentional fluidity around names. For example, some travelers traveled under aliases. This was the case for elite travelers such as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/725\">Lord Bute</a> (1713–92, travel years 1768–69) who, just a few years after his demise as prime minister of England, traveled incognito as Chevalier Stuart, and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1927\">Lady Gerard</a> (d. 1793, travel years 1724–26), who kept herself “conceal’d and does not declare her True name; [the one she uses] is Plummer.” Other travelers concealed their original names to escape past indictments or to run from debt, as in the case of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1728\">Henry Fisher</a> (c. 1710–after 1768, travel years 1730–86), who assumed the name of Howard but was imprisoned on suspicion of being “the Fisher that committed the barbarous murther upon the body of his friend Mr Derby,” or <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1315\">Davenport</a> (travel years 1703–4), who, when in debt in Rome, is said to have claimed to be Williamson, a moneyed figure in Leghorn/Livorno. These and other stories of name changes—because of adoption, inheritance, and new identities—are told in the traveler lives preserved in the Explorer. These are stories of self-reinvention that are not captured fully by the Names category but that word-searching for a particular “name” brings to the surface.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"birth-date\">Birth Date</h2>\n\n<p>This four-digit numeric data category is complete for 2,439 travelers (40.6 percent) entered in the Explorer. For around a quarter of these, the years of birth are qualified by word markers that indicate some measure of uncertainty or approximation, such as <em>circa</em>, <em>by</em>, or <em>after</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> These markers are string data; in the Explorer, they are made visible, displayed next to the year of birth in the left column of the travelers’ individual entries. In the tabular download of the data from the Explorer, they are recorded in the column “markers” next to that for year of birth.</p>\n\n<p>When working with the year-of-birth data, grasping its uneven distribution across time is just as important as understanding how complete or uncertain it is. The earliest year of birth for a traveler in the database is 1634, the latest 1806, and both are unique instances: only one person is born in 1634 and only one in 1806. These two are outliers: most of the travelers (93 percent) were born between 1677 and 1777, and most years between 1730 and 1770 register between twenty-five and forty records each. Moreover, the individuals recorded as being born in 1634 and 1806 are not easily counted as Grand Tourists: the first is the approximate date of birth of a long-term resident merchant in Leghorn/Livorno—<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4291\">Gilbert Serle</a> (c. 1634–1712, years of travel –1704-11)—and the second that of the youngest daughter of a long-term resident and navy commander in Naples—<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/18.5\">Elizabeth Acton</a> (1806–47, travel years 1806–29). Most of the travelers in the database with the earliest dates of birth are long-term residents, including merchants, diplomats, or members of the Jacobite court. The first to fit the profile of a Grand Tourist—traveling in his twenties with a tutor before accessing his family title—is <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/115\">John Campbell</a>, 2nd Duke of Argyll (1680–1743, travel years 1701, 1711, and 1712), born forty-six years later then Serle. At the other end, most travelers with late dates of birth were born in Italy rather than having traveled there. The latest year of birth for a tourist not born in Italy is that of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1197\">Lady Caroline Creighton</a> (1779–1856, travel years 1785–90, GTE 1197), daughter of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1619\">Lady Erne</a> (1753–1842, travel years 1785–90) and granddaughter of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/587\">Lord Bristol</a> (1730–1803, travel years 1765–66, 1770–72, 1777–79, 1785–86, 1789–90, 1794–1803), who traveled with her mother and grandfather at the age of six. As stated earlier, the overall distribution of birth years across the century reflects a distinct increase in women travelers. Between 1634 and 1700, less than 4 percent of the 480 recorded dates of birth are for females. But this percentage more than doubles between 1701 and 1749, when there are 1,295 dates of birth, of which 9.4 percent are those of females; and finally, between 1750 and 1806, there are 662 records, of which just over 20 percent are those of females.<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"death-date\">Death Date</h2>\n\n<p>This four-digit numeric data category is complete for 2,672 of the travelers (44.5 percent). For eighty-two of these, the death year, like the birth year, is qualified by word markers indicating some measure of uncertainty or approximation, such as <em>circa</em>, <em>by</em>, or <em>after</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> And, as for the birth years, these qualifying markers are also string data: the Explorer displays qualifiers next to the death year in the left-hand column of the travelers’ individual entries. In the tabular download of Explorer data, they are recorded in the column labeled “markers” adjacent to the death year. Noticeably, the database contains many more death dates than birth dates, and the death dates appear to be much more certain—622 birthdates have qualifying markers versus only 82 death dates.</p>\n\n<p>Just as when working with the birthdate data, grasping the uneven distribution of death dates across time remains as important as understanding how complete or uncertain the data is. Again, the overall distribution of death dates across the century, considered together with gender data, reflects a distinct increase in women travelers. Between 1701 and 1749, of the 443 deaths recorded, less than 5.87 percent are females. This percentage more than doubles between 1750 and 1806, when there are 1,378 death dates, of which 12.6 percent are female; and finally, for the 851 death dates after 1806, just over 16.5 percent are females.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup> Looking closer at the earliest dates of death, at the beginning of the century there are twenty-six deaths recorded before 1710, and all are men—many long-term merchants and military men for whom there is no birthdate, so it is not possible to gauge their age. A few do fit the typical profile of Grand Tourists—traveling after attending a Cambridge or Oxford college for an educational Grand Tour—who died young. The two sons of the poet Dryden, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1494\">John</a> (1667/8–1703, travel years c. 1692–1703) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1494.1\">Charles</a> (1666–1704, travel years 1692–1703), traveled to Italy, mixing Catholic passion and Grand Tour interests, and both died young from accidents—John in Rome and Charles back home in England. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3821\">Charles Perrott</a> (c. 1677–1706, travel years 1704–6) died of a sudden illness in Venice. Looking at the end of the century, the travelers with the six latest death years (spanning 1861 to 1873) include three women, and the latest recorded death year of 1873 belongs to <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/18.2\">Mary Anne Acton</a> (1786–1873, travel years 1800–1811), who was the mother of Elizabeth Acton, referenced previously as the traveler with the latest recorded birth year in the Explorer data.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"flourished\">Flourished</h2>\n\n<p>For some travelers the print <em>Dictionary</em> does not give dates of birth and death but, instead, includes years of “flourishing”—amounting, it seems, to years of known activity—indicated by the abbreviation <em>fl.</em> This numeric data exists for sixty-three travelers; nine of the given years are accompanied by markers of uncertainty in string data form (“c.,” “?,” “late,” “after”). For five travelers, only a single year of flourishing is given, but for the remaining travelers, their flourishing years are expressed as a time span; of these, the widest time span is fifty years of flourishing for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3726\">John Panzetta</a> (fl. 1780–1830, travel years –1787), and the shortest span is three years of flourishing for <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3738\">William Parker</a> (fl. 1722–25, travel years 1722–25). The Explorer displays years of flourishing under “flourished” in the left-hand column of the travelers’ individual entries. This data is not actionable in the Explorer, nor is it downloadable in tabular form from the Explorer; however, it is included in the data sheets in the Stanford Data Repository files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"birth-place\">Birth Place</h2>\n\n<p>Placenames for where travelers were born range in specificity from town name to the name of an entire country. This is string data, appearing as words in the Explorer display and in the downloaded tabular format. Birthplaces are sparsely known and recorded in the database; there are only eighty-four unique locations accounting for 132 travelers’ births, meaning just over 2 percent of the Explorer’s travelers have birthplace data recorded. The number is too small to make any generalization, but within this small set, around half are locations in England, Ireland, or Scotland; a quarter are in Italy; and the rest span Europe, North America, and South Asia. The top five birthplace cities recorded are in Italy, England, and Ireland: eleven travelers were born in Rome, Italy; nine in Dublin, Ireland; eight in London, England; six in Leghorn/Livorno, Italy; and five in Florence, Italy.</p>\n\n<p>The Italian births include both children born to elite travelers journeying through Italy and children born to long-term Italian residents such as painters, architects, or diplomats. Among the travelers born in locations outside Italy, England, and Ireland, one finds American painters who traveled to Italy for their Grand Tour from Philadelphia. Other birthplaces point to how the British Empire and the Grand Tour are entwined; records show young men born in the Caribbean and in India—the children of enslavers, plantation owners, and colonial officers—who traveled back to England to attend Oxbridge and then take the Grand Tour in the educational tradition of elites. Other foreign births tell stories of work travels, of merchants and entrepreneurs who set off from Britain and settled as far away as Smyrna, Göteborg, or Russia. In these far-flung locations, for example, were born the architect <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/881\">William Chambers</a> (1723-96, travel years 1750-55) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/241.2\">Grace Barker</a> (travel year 1791)—respectively to a British and a Scottish merchant—and the painter <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1172\">Alexander Cozens</a> (1717-86, travel year 1746)—to a British shipbuilder.</p>\n\n<p>Of the 132 travelers with recorded places of birth, twenty-three are female (the large majority of which, seventeen, are hidden figures). Although this is barely above the overall percentage of female travelers in the Explorer data altogether (17.1 percent vs. 15.9 percent), it is notable because in general, the data points for women are much scarcer than those for men. Yet when one compares the places of birth for men and women travelers, distinct differences emerge. For women, most of the recorded birth places—sixteen of twenty-three—are for Italian locations, while for men that number decreases to only 11 out of 106. Even considering just the women with original entries in the <em>Dictionary</em> (six out of the twenty-free), half of them have Italian birth places. Overall, this shows how the women who entered this world of the Grand Tour—and the Explorer database—were neither typical Grand Tourists (elite men whose birth place is recorded alongside rich data in education and occupation) nor artists (with few noticeable exceptions, such as Read, who is one of the six original entries with birth place recorded). But they were also actively embedded in long-term exchanges between Italy and England, with vital links through marriages and long-term stays, which manifests in the data in this distinctive way. To explore this data further, note that the Explorer displays birth placenames in the left-hand column of individual entries, and that it is included in the tabular data download.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"death-place\">Death Place</h2>\n\n<p>Like places of birth, geographical locations where travelers died range in specificity from town names to country names. This is string data, appearing as a search field on the Explore page, as well as in words in both the Explorer entries’ display and the downloaded tabular format. Places of death are sparsely known and recorded in the database; there are only seventy-one unique locations accounting for 320 travelers’ deaths, meaning just over 5 percent of the Explorer’s travelers have recorded death-location data. Again, the number is too low for generalization, yet one readily sees that more travelers die in Italy than are born there: while a quarter of the recorded births were in Italy, more than 80 percent of recorded deaths are in Italian locations, while less than half of the placenames recorded are in Italy (thirty-two out of seventy-one). The top five cities where traveler deaths are recorded are all in Italy: Leghorn/Livorno, with seventy recorded deaths; Rome, with sixty-seven; Naples, with forty; Florence, with twenty; and Venice, with sixteen. Of the thirty-nine death locations outside Italy, ten are in the British Isles, six in British colonies and outposts, and the remainder spread across Europe. Of all these non-Italian locations, six places have two death records each, while the rest have only one.</p>\n\n<p>When considering gender, there are sixty-four women with records of place of death, of which twenty-two are newly created entries. We have records of place of death for women travelers at a higher rate than for men (6.7 percent vs. 5.11 percent), which is striking when, in general, data for women is scarcer. But also striking is that Italian places dominate even more the records of women than those of men (67.18 percent vs. 58.82 percent), pointing to deep Italian affinities in these women’s lives. At the same time, though, only twelve different locations are recorded for women, while twenty-eight are recorded for men. Besides the shared best-known locations (Leghorn/Livorno, Rome, Naples, Florence, Venice, Pisa, Palermo, and Milan), the records for men also include other well-known cities (such as Genoa or Turin) that do not appear in the women’s records, as well as many more remote places that point to more extensive and varied travel. Even in this small sample of data, there are questions about gender and mobility, as well as gender and recording, that call for further exploration.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"parents\">Parents</h2>\n\n<p>This data gives the names of the parents of travelers when recorded in the database. The database contains this information for around 40% of the travelers. There are 3,110 records for 2,462 travelers, meaning that for 648 travelers, two parents are recorded. For almost a third of these records (1,151) there is an Entry ID, meaning that these parents are also travelers in the database. In some cases, the data includes additional information retrieved from the <em>Dictionary</em>. For 1,323 records, the order of birth is recorded, expressed as a numeric value or as abbreviations: “e” for elder, “o” for older, “yr” for younger, and “yst” for youngest. In other cases, other notations are recorded: “surviving” (228), “heir” (54), “illegitimate,” (25) and “posthumous” (3).</p>\n\n<p>Out of the travelers with parent data, almost a fifth (444) are women, and of these women the great majority—303, that is, almost 70%—are hidden figures. This not surprising, given that many of these women’s presences were recovered through family relations. Yet this data also shows that among the entries for women in the <em>Dictionary</em>, a large majority had records for their parents. There are thus complexities around who is counted and in what terms, but also a clear indication that more needs to be done to understand family connections on the Grand Tour in relation to women.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"marriage\">Marriage</h2>\n\n<p>The database contains marriage information for around one-third of the travelers. This data consists of a spouse name, the marriage year, and (when a traveler remarried) a sequence number. This clearly defined tripartite structure varies greatly. What is preserved and recorded of the spouse names might include forename, surname, and title, or sometimes just a forename or, in a few cases, not even that—we only know there was a marriage. The marriage year is absent for a quarter of the records and, in a few instances, is accompanied by qualifiers showing uncertainty. In five cases, neither the spouse’s name nor the marriage date is known but, rather, mere confirmation that the traveler married at some point.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> Of the 2,011 travelers whose marriages are recorded, 272 married a second time and 31 a third time. “Marriage” is not a search field on the Explore page, but marriage data is displayed in the individual traveler’s entry when known, showing the spouse’s name followed by marriage date in parentheses. Where spouses also have Explorer entries, their name appears in blue font as an actionable link. Multiple marriages appear in subsequent rows, one under the other. As downloaded data from the Explorer, marriage data appears in the “Travelers_Life_Events” table among other life events, with the marriage sequence number listed in the column labeled as “eventsDetail1,” the spouse name in the next column labeled as “eventsDetail2,” and the marriage year in the column labeled as “start date.”</p>\n\n<p>Understanding women’s presence in this marriage data better reveals how they feature in <em>A World Made by Travel</em>. Of the travelers for whom marriage data is known, 596 are women. This means that, proportionally, marriages are recorded in the Explorer data for many more women than men (29.7 percent of the marriage data concerns women, who make up only 15.9 percent of travelers). This is less surprising when considering that many women have become visible in the database precisely because of their married status; in fact, of the 640 women with marriage data, 130 records are hidden figures, recovered from the entries of their spouses’ entries. The marriage-status question persists, though, for the thirty-two women in this data set with an original <em>Dictionary</em> entry: did these women travel before or after marriage, alone or with their spouse?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dbiti-employments--identifiers\"><em>DBITI</em> Employments &amp; Identifiers</h2>\n\n<p>These are the terms in the <em>Dictionary</em> that describe travelers’ endeavors, achievements, interests, and defining characteristics. They are listed after the traveler’s name and any recorded biographical dates but before any further biographical information. Around one-sixth of the travelers in the Explorer have these brief descriptors; 914 travelers share 212 terms, and many have two, three, or even four such identifiers. This string data is searchable in a dedicated field on the Explore page, and it is also displayed in individual entries as a blue, actionable link leading to other travelers sharing that term (that is, clicking on <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2754\">William Kent</a>’s <em>DBITI</em> Employments &amp; Identifiers data on “architect” lists <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22pursuits%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22architect%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">the others</a> with the “architect” identifier). In the downloaded data from the Explorer, <em>DBITI</em> Employments and Identifiers data is found in the “Travelers_Life_Events” table in the column for “eventsDetail2.”</p>\n\n<p>This data appears simple in that it consists only of basic terms. Its complexity, however, resides in understanding its pervasively nonsystematic nature. The terms that appear in this data set are both specific and repetitive, with slight variations, privileging the unique over the categorical. This reflects the richness and variety of the writing in the <em>Dictionary</em>. <em>DBITI</em> is the abbreviation for <em>Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em> and is meant to remind readers that this information comes directly from the <em>Dictionary</em>, with no further formalization. Here, though, is an attempt to organize the employments and identifiers terms, while also giving a sense of their breadth and variety:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Descriptors can include the travelers’ professions, the means by which their lives were defined and sustained. These range from “actor” to “diplomat,” “statesman,” “inn-keeper,” and “impresario.” Sometimes they can be as specific as “architectural publisher” or delineate specialties or type of goods, such as “timber merchant,” “textile merchant,” or “wine merchant.”</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>They can express a defining moment or achievement in travelers’ careers. Examples include “bishop” or “editor of Shakespeare.”</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>They can indicate a defining passionate interest, such as “bibliophile,” “collector,” “patron,” as well as various labels, such as “amateur architect,” “amateur artist,” “amateur musician,” and “amateur painter.”</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>They might offer a personal characteristic, such as “eccentric,” “hedonist,” “miscreant,” or “bon vivant.”</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>They can be an identity—whether national, political, or religious. Examples include “American,” “Scottish,” “Catholic,” “Jacobite,” “Dominican,” and “Jesuit.”</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The descriptor data maintains any original alternative spelling, such as “antiquarian” and “antiquary,” or “dilettanti” and “dilettante.” Variations abound; for example, a few travelers are described simply as “writer,” but many more are listed with variations on this category: “agricultural writer,” “author,” “biographer,” “dilettante poet,” “dramatist,” “essayist,” “historian,” “historian of art,” “journalist,” “literary scholar,” “man of letters,” “military historian,” “miscellaneous writer,” “mystical writer,” “novelist,” “occasional writer,” “pamphleteer,” “playwright,” “poet,” and “poetaster.” This dazzling variety is a reminder of how illuminating the <em>DBITI</em> Employments and Identifiers data can be as a means to enter the world of eighteenth-century travelers to Italy; it also indicates that one should explore them in full rather than relying on any individual result to offer systematic insight across the database. As for women, <em>DBITI</em> Employments and Identifiers data is particularly sparse. Only 26 of the 914 travelers with this data are women (2.8 percent), six of them with two terms each. But for four exceptions (“hotel keeper,” “barmaid,” “Jacobite,” and “courtesan”), all the identifiers for women pertain to the visual and performing arts.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"education\">Education</h2>\n\n<p>The database contains education information for 1,202 travelers, around one-fifth of the total. In most cases, it indicates primary and secondary schools, colleges, universities, or other specialized institutions (whether religious, legal, or artistic). At times, it includes degrees obtained and dates of attendance. There are also cases of travelers studying under specific teachers or apprenticing with specific experts; most often, this is the case for artists and architects. In some cases, only the education location—given as the city or the country—is recorded. This education data is structured around the categories of “Institution” (there are 107 institutions for 1,639 records), “Place” (there are sixty-nine places for 1,734 records), “Degree” (146 records), “Teacher” (ninety-six teachers for 123 records), and “Date” (1,147 dates, given as years of attendance or of degree attained). Under “Education” on the Explorer’s Explore and Search pages, there is a field in each to search for institution, place, teacher, and degree. On individual entries, the educational institutions, places, degrees, and teachers are listed in blue font as actionable links, whereas dates appear next to relevant data in parentheses in nonactionable black font—all in a single line. When downloaded in tabular format, this data is accommodated in the “Travelers_Life_Events” table; following the column “Life_Events” is “Education,” with teacher or degree placed in the “eventsDetail1” column, and the institution in the “eventsDetail2” column, followed by the place and date when recorded.</p>\n\n<p>The institutions appearing under this category represent a variety of British grammar and public schools (Eton and Westminster are the most represented, with 199 and 141 records, respectively), including some no longer in existence, such as Newcome’s School and Shackleton School. Most Cambridge and Oxford colleges are represented—Cambridge with 307 records and Oxford with 439. All four Inns of Court for the study of law have data—Lincoln’s Inn with sixty-three records, Middle Temple with forty-two, Inner Temple with thirty-four, and Gray’s Inn with twelve. The data covers many art schools, as well: the Royal Academy Schools, founded in 1768, with forty-four records; the Dublin Society Schools of Drawings, founded in 1746, with twelve; and the Trustees Drawing Academy in Edinburgh, founded in 1760, with three. Some earlier, more ephemeral, art schools are also recorded: di Graffiani’s Academy, Duke of Richmond’s Cast Gallery, the Foulis Academy of Fine Arts, Fournier’s Academy, Grisoni, Great Queen Street Academy, Shipley’s Art Academy, St. Martin’s Lane Academy, and Vanderbank’s Academy. Travelers are recorded as having attended a number of universities outside of England, including in Ireland (Trinity College Dublin), Scotland (Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and St. Andrews), France (Sorbonne), Germany (Göttingen, Leipzig), the United States (Harvard, Yale), the Netherlands (Leiden), and Switzerland (Geneva). Finally, travelers attended Continental Catholic schools (Douai, St. Omer College, and Saumur) and military academies (Angers, Caen, Fontainebleau, Turin, and Vaudeuil). Teachers under whom some travelers (artists in most cases) studied or trained outside of an institution include famous names and travelers themselves, such as Benjamin West, Joshua Reynolds, and William Chambers. But teacher data also includes some obscure names, or the mere notation “his father,” all of which are preserved in the data as such. These educational records reveal institutional stories as well as individual ones, some that span nations.</p>\n\n<p>They tell, too, of a world that is almost exclusively male. The only educational record for a woman belongs to <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4047\">Katherine Read</a> (1723–78, travel years 1751–53), documenting her education under Quentin de la Tour, Paris (1745). Her <em>Dictionary</em> entry reveals that she was regularly accompanied in Italy by the Abbé Grant since “no unmarried woman is seen in the street alone,” and, as a woman, she was not allowed to attend academies, nor was she allowed to visit all the galleries in Naples.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"occupations--posts\">Occupations &amp; Posts</h2>\n\n<p>Occupations and posts listed in the <em>Dictionary</em> range from political appointments and honors to trades and crafts. The Explorer data records 256 such positions and professions, for about 25 percent of travelers in the database (1,522 of them). Often the records of these occupations and posts are accompanied by additional information, such as dates or places. Sometimes this additional information consists of details like the names of people for whom travelers worked or titles of books they wrote. Among the myriad biographical data in the Explorer database, this is one of the most varied and rich data sets. It is organized under eleven thematic groupings—an added interpretative layer designed to assist in grasping this variegated data. On the Explore and Search pages, the Occupations and Posts category can be searched either by using these eleven groupings or as a full list. On the individual entry pages, this data is displayed in the left column under the relevant grouping title as a blue, actionable link; dates appear in parentheses in nonactionable black font. When downloaded, this data appears in “Travelers_Life_Events,” following the column “occupation,” with the grouping placed in the “eventsDetail1” column, followed in the next column “eventsDetail2” by the specific occupation or post. Places, names of employers, titles of publication, and dates appear in the next columns. The vagaries of this data are explained in brief below.</p>\n\n<p>The Occupations and Posts group with the most travelers is that of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Statesmen%20and%20Political%20Appointees%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Statesmen and Political Appointees</a>, which counts 887 travelers. Of these, the great majority (703) were members of Parliament, but other posts include appointments at court (including the Jacobite court in Rome), governorships of colonies, and positions in the governing structure of the East India Company. There are also British mayors and, more notably, one president of the newly independent United States. When downloaded in tabular form, posts are listed in the column “eventsDetail2” and followed, when recorded, by dates and location.</p>\n\n<p>The next-most-populated group is that of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Army%20and%20Navy%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Army and Navy</a>, with 305 records for 301 travelers. When downloaded in tabular form, the column “eventsDetail2” lists these travelers as either an army or naval officer (247 and 60 records, respectively), followed by the sparsely recorded locations of service (the eight non-British locations include Sardinia, Austria, Russia, and Prussia) and dates.</p>\n\n<p>Under <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Diplomacy%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Diplomacy</a> are 402 records for 203 travelers. When downloaded in tabular form, the next column, “eventsDetail2,” is fully filled in and runs the gamut of positions for these travelers in eighteenth-century British diplomatic service. Locations listed under “place/employer/pub” in the next column include the full scope of Italian sites of British diplomacy but also many farther afield in Europe, the Mediterranean, and beyond, reaching as far north as Sweden and east to Constantinople, Russia, and China. Most records also have dates.<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The next-most-populated category is <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Scholars,%20Academics,%20Authors%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Scholars, Academics, and Authors</a>, with 240 records for 178 travelers, showing a great variety of occupations and posts. The most numerous among these are “authors,” of which there are seventy-one, followed by fifty-two “fellows,” and twenty-eight “professors” of various subjects. The latter two are usually listed together with their institutions of learning, such as colleges, universities, and academies. In the downloaded tabular version of the data, these institution names are listed under the column “place/employer/pub” followed by dates in the subsequent columns when available. For authors, translators, and editors, the title of the works written, translated, or edited appears under “place/employer/pub.”<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Clergy%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Clergy</a> group counts 296 records for 154 travelers. This discrepancy lies in the nature of a British clerical career, which involved moving from post to post across space and time—all recorded in the Explorer data. For example, an individual might start as a rector at an Oxford college, advance to a number of prebendaries, and end up as a canon at Westminster, all in the course of two decades. Fifty records are for “ordained” travelers, with indication of date but no place. Where recorded, these clergy locations are mostly British, but they also include places outside England—in cities such as Paris, Lisbon, and Leghorn/Livorno. Some clergy were posted at institutions or assigned to households, with postings ranging from the British factory at Leghorn/Livorno to the royal house to other titled families.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Artists,%20Architects,%20Craftsmen%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Artists, Architects, Craftsmen</a> group includes 106 records for seventy-seven travelers. The largest number of records are for architects, with dates of employment in various institutions (foremost of which is the office of Works) but also with individuals. Musicians, visual artists (painters and sculptors alike), and engravers are also well represented, employed by institutions, households, and individuals (including other artists). These employers feature under “place/employer/pub” in the data download. Masons appear in this group—the craftsmen of architecture, employed by the same institutions as some of the architects—as do evocative posts such as the musical director of the theater in Calcutta.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Law%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Law</a> group has fifty-three records for forty-nine travelers. When downloaded in tabular form, all but nine have “called to the bar” in the next column of “eventsDetail2” and have no record of place, but they do have a date for when they were admitted to the legal profession. Most of the remaining records detail judiciary appointments, together with specific locations, all of which are outside England (three in Scotland, one each in Dublin, Bengal, Jamaica, and Pennsylvania).</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Domestic%20Service%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Domestic Service</a> group has forty-five records for forty-six travelers. This category includes many of the restored hidden figures whose identities and travels are in the <em>Dictionary</em> but subsumed in the service (and entries) of others and, at times, recorded not with a name but only with the definition of servant. There are also instances of “servants” in the <em>Dictionary</em>’s original entries. This category in the Explorer data runs the gamut from tutor and governess to attendant. A disconnect exists in the name for this category—how can “domestic” refer to a traveler?—but it underscores also the particularity of these positions in the world of travelers, these individuals who were all the more essential in nourishing the intimacy of a home while on the go. Because of the numerous hidden figures who are disproportionally women, this category numbers as many women as men. Nonetheless, this category remains among the least populated—at the opposite end of the spectrum from the numerous recorded MPs—because it concerns those most susceptible to erasure in the records.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Finance%20and%20Trade%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Finance and Trade</a> group includes forty-one records for thirty-seven travelers. Most numerous in this group are records for merchants, followed by directors and governors, then bankers, and then other trade or administrative positions. When downloaded in tabular from, geographical locations are listed under “place/employer/pub,” be these the cities or regions where merchants and bankers worked (such as Leghorn/Livorno or West India), but also institutions where directors and governors served (foremost the Bank of England). There are also rarer instances of specificity, such as the case of “the manager for the Clives Estates,” manager of the Queen’s Theatre in London, and the “agent for Irish Tourists.”</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Patrons%20and%20Founders%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Patrons and Founders</a> group counts thirty-two records for thirty-one travelers. The majority (twenty-six) served as trustees of the British Museum. There are three founders (of a museum, a Cambridge college, and an almshouse, all given under “place/employer/pub”) and two patrons (one of an academy and one of an artist, both given under “place/employer/pub”).</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Physicians%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Physicians</a> group includes thirty-four records for twenty-eight travelers. Most are listed as physicians, but there are seven records for surgeons, and one each for an apothecary, an oculist, and a director-general. Data in the “place/employer/pub” column varies; some travelers are recorded as having served in actual locations (Dublin and Aylesbury, for example), whereas others served institutions ranging from hospitals to factories abroad, a boat, or the military forces, and still others served individuals in the Royal House. Dates are available for most records.</p>\n\n<p>The Occupations and Posts category is the most varied in terms of position types. It also encompasses the greatest span of status for travelers, from prime ministers to servants. The category, however, is monolithic in terms of gender. Only ten of the almost 1,500 who have data in this category are women—less than 0.5 percent. Many of the eleven groupings were closed entirely to women, including clergy, diplomacy, law, physicians, and the military. The two most-represented groupings for women are service categories that exist at somewhat opposite ends of the class spectrum: there are two women in <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Domestic%20Service%22%7D%5D%7D,%22type%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Female%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Domestic Service</a> (a maid and a governess) and four in <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22type%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Female%22%7D%5D%7D,%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Statesmen%20and%20Political%20Appointees%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Statesmen and Political Appointees</a> (attendants to the queen and princess: a unique sort of domestic service that is here placed among political appointments). Besides these women, there are <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22type%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Female%22%7D%5D%7D,%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Scholars,%20Academics,%20Authors%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">two more</a> in Scholars, Academics, Authors and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22type%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Female%22%7D%5D%7D,%22occupations_group%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Artists,%20Architects,%20Craftsmen%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">one</a> “figurante at the Opera” in Artists, Architects, Craftsmen. That the more famous writers, such as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3395\">Lady Montagu</a> (1689-1762, travel years 1718, 1739-41, 1746-61), <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3880\">Hester Piozzi</a> (1741–1821, travel years 1784–86), and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4512\">Mariana Starke</a> (c. 1762–1838, travel years 1792–98), or painters, such as Katherine Read, Anne Parson, and Emma Greenland, do not appear in these Occupations and Posts groups is a reminder of the limits of these categories, as efforts at formalization weighed faithfulness to the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entry structure against clarity and consistency. One will find these other women acknowledged in the <em>DBITI</em> Employments and Identifiers under “writers” and “painters.” Indeed, there one finds as many as 165 painters, which is more than twice as many travelers as those listed in the Artists, Architects, Craftsmen grouping of Occupations and Posts. When searching for specific qualities, attributes, and professions across the travelers, the best practice is to use multiple categories and dimensions—as well as to use the free word search feature.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"military-careers\">Military Careers</h2>\n\n<p>This category lists the ranks for travelers who served in the military, with 723 records across 265 travelers. This large discrepancy hints at how many travelers with military careers—more than two-thirds of them—held multiple posts as they rose in army or navy rank. In this sense, this data serves as an extension of the army and navy grouping under the Occupations and Posts category, particularly for officers for whom various ranks were recorded. In the Occupations and Posts category, the data expresses whether a traveler served as an army or navy officer, together with dates and places when available (ranging from an actual location name to a regiment or commander under whom they served). By contrast, the Military Careers category lists the traveler’s various ranks acquired together with dates when available. The dates cover the traveler’s initial entry into the military and subsequent promotions in rank—as well as, in one case, a date of dismissal. The great majority of military records concern the British Army or Navy, but in some instances, travelers joined a foreign service; these circumstances are revealed by either the non-English wording of the rank or by the place of service listed in Occupations and Posts. In the Explorer, “military careers” is a search field on the Explore page. The military careers data appears also in the left-hand column of a traveler’s entry, under the heading of the same name; the ranks are listed as a blue, actionable link that opens a list of all other travelers with the same military rank, while the dates are in parentheses in nonactionable black font. When the data is downloaded, it appears in the “Travelers_Life_Events” table in the rows following the “Life_Events” column labeled “military career.” “eventsDetail1” states the branch of service, and “eventsDetail2” gives the rank (spelled out in full rather than the abbreviations used in the original <em>Dictionary</em> entries). The “place/employer/pub” column is always empty, and the dates, when recorded, are given in the next column.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>There are no women in this data set, and it consists of a small sample of travelers (less than 5 percent). Nonetheless, this data set contains significant information density. It raises new questions about the world of travelers to Italy that researchers can begin to approach systematically, such as how military careers correlate with education levels and other professions, or whether travelers with military careers are on the Grand Tour for reasons related to their service. Are they visiting Italy as part of campaigns, intentionally adding a tourist element to their service, or are they simply tourists who happen to have served in the military? The relationship between wars and the Grand Tour has been considered in terms of how wartime disrupted travel, but there might be new dimensions to explore starting from this set of military careers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"societies--academies\">Societies &amp; Academies</h2>\n\n<p>These are the travelers’ cultural, artistic, and professional associations and affiliations, ranging from music to the visual arts, and from medicine to engineering. The Explorer data contains 701 records corresponding to 501 travelers’ affiliations, with twenty-four different societies and academies. The discrepancy in numbers attests both to the fact that travelers belonged to multiple associations and to the fact that some travelers played different roles at different times within the same society or academy. This data category consists of society or academy names, the travelers’ roles in the given organizations, and the dates associated with each role (when recorded, which is the case almost 90 percent of the time). The most populated associations are the Society of Dilettanti (with 222 records), the Royal Society (with 214 records), the Society of Antiquaries (with 140 records), followed by—after a significant drop—the Royal Academy (with 40 records). Among the roles, “fellow” is by far the most attested (366 records), followed by “member” (248 records). Other roles are much more sparsely attested, such as “associate member” (29 records) and “president” (19 records). A few are unique, such as “leader of expedition to Asia Minor,” “accompanied Dilettanti’s expedition to Greece and Turkey,” and “declined.” Nine of the twenty-four associations are non-English (four Scottish, two Irish, and one each American, Italian, and German). In the data download, this data is in the “Travelers_Life_Events” table with “society” in the “lifeEvents” column, showing the role in “eventsDetail1,” the institution in “eventsDetail2,” and providing the year under “startDate” and “endDate.”</p>\n\n<p>This is another data set within the Explorer that—like military careers—is solely male and that, while small, is information-dense. It is interesting that the great majority of the travelers holding three different records for society and academy associations (twenty-six out of thirty-one) share affiliations with the same three (Society of Antiquaries, Society of Dilettanti, and the Royal Society).</p>\n\n<p>The data for membership in societies can be interrogated in conjunction with member characteristics such as education or social status to explore the largest and smallest numbers of overlaps, who the outliers are, and so forth. It is vital while exploring this data to consider the lifespans of these societies and academies. To ensure comparison of comparable data, take into account that different societies were founded at different times, and some did not exist throughout the eighteenth century. Here is a list of the twenty-four associations in descending order of their membership numbers in the Explorer data, along with dates of establishment: Society of Dilettanti (222 travelers, est. 1734); Royal Society (214 travelers, est. 1660); Society of Antiquaries (140 travelers, est. 1717); Royal Academy (40 travelers, est. 1768); Architects’ Club (11 travelers, est. 1792); Royal College of Physicians (10 travelers, est. 1518); Society of Artists (8 travelers, est. 1760); Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (3 travelers, est. 1780); Royal Society of Musicians (2 travelers, est. 1738); Society of Virtuosi of St. Luke (two travelers, c. 1689-1743); and Free Society of Artists (2 travelers, 1761–83). Associations with only one traveler affiliated: Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (est. 1681); Royal Society of Berlin (est. 1700); Hell-Fire Club (c. 1730s–60s); Royal Medical Society Edinburgh (est. 1734); Society for the Encouragement of Learning (est. 1735); American Philosophical Society (est. 1743); Royal Society of Arts (est. 1754); Society of Civil Engineers (est. 1771); Society for Promoting the Arts in Liverpool (1783); Royal Irish Academy (est. 1785); British and Foreign Bible Society (est. 1804); Old Water Colour Society (est. 1804); and Royal Hibernian Academy (est. 1823).<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"exhibitions--awards\">Exhibitions &amp; Awards</h2>\n\n<p>These are records for the art exhibitions in which travelers displayed their work, as well as for any prizes and educational fellowships they were awarded. There are 419 records for 147 travelers. The data consists of the institution names that hosted exhibitions and granted prizes and fellowships, as well as any specific awards received. There are ten institutions and forty-five awards granted. Dates are also included in the data when known, and they pertain to either exhibit or award years. By and large, these records concern visual art, but there are also a few traveling scholarships given to doctors, scholars, and artists. The Explore and Search pages have two different search fields listed under the Exhibitions and Awards category—one for the institution, and one for the award type. In an individual traveler’s entry, these fields are combined, separated by a comma, and both appear as a blue, actionable link leading to the list of travelers who share the same exhibition or award. Dates appear next to relevant data in parentheses in nonactionable black font. In the data download, this data is in the “Travelers_Life_Events” table with “exhibition” in the “lifeEvents” column, showing the institution or award in “eventsDetail2” and providing the year under “startDate” and “endDate.”</p>\n\n<p>By far the most populated of the ten institutions is the Royal Academy, where 120 artists exhibited. With such overall small numbers, though, what is perhaps most notable is the representation of a diverse set of institutions. Moreover, four women artists are represented in the records: <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22exhibitions%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Royal%20Academy%22%7D%5D%7D,%22type%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Female%22%7\">four</a> exhibited at the Royal Academy and one of these four, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4047\">Katherine Read</a>, exhibited earlier at the Society for Artists and at the Free Society of Artists. Both the exhibitions and the traveling scholarships were deeply entwined with the Grand Tour: artists displayed works made in Italy, and the traveling scholarships were essentially dedicated to learning while traveling in Italy.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"indexical-data\">Indexical Data</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"sources\">Sources</h2>\n\n<p>These are the records for sources referenced in the entries, consisting of published titles and archival material, that appear in the <em>Dictionary</em>’s footnotes and extensive bibliography. There are 545 sources, and a majority of entries (69 percent) reference at least one. The most commonly referenced sources are archives: appearing in <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22sources%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22or%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22ASV%20IS%20758-781%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">677 entries</a>, the State Archives in Venice are the most referenced, due  mainly to the Note dei Forestieri, which records visitors coming to and leaving Venice in the eighteenth century. The second most referenced, with <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22sources%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Brown%201921%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">641 entries</a>, is the 1931 publication of the University of Padua’s visitor register, and the third, with <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22sources%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Wal.Corr.%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">405 entries</a>, is the published Walpole Correspondence.<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> Archival and manuscript material—whether published or not, public or private, Italian or British—represents the majority of sources, along with some eighteenth-century published traveler accounts. Some secondary literature is included, but it is important to remember that it dates at the latest to the 1990s. Much has been published since, as the <em>Dictionary</em> itself, published in 1997, spurred many later publications.<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Women are underrepresented overall among entries with sources, counting for only 6.5 percent (while overall in the database they represent 16 percent of entries). This is not surprising given that hidden figures entries are less likely to have sources. It is interesting, though, to consider these numbers with respect to individual sources, starting with the most cited ones. In the Venetian Note dei Forestieri, women account for 10 percent of the citations; <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22type%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Female%22%7D%5D%7D,%22sources%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Brown%201921%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">in the records of the University of Padua</a>, they account for less than 1 percent (three out of 641); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22type%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Female%22%7D%5D%7D,%22sources%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Wal.Corr.%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">in the Walpole correspondence</a>, they account for 11 percent. It would be worthwhile to explore further how much the archival records differ from personal accounts in mentioning women.</p>\n\n<p>This data appears in abbreviated title form in the search box for sources on the Explore page. On each entry page, the data appears in abbreviated form in the left-hand column under “Sources”; hovering the cursor, though, displays the full source title. A quotation mark appears beside the data as a blue actionable link leading to a list of all entries sharing the same source. In the tabular download, this data appears in the “Travelers” table in the “Sources” column in abbreviated form and separated by commas. This data consists of bibliographical information, which, formalized as data, gives some systematic insight into the construction of and connections within <em>Dictionary</em> content. This data allows new ways of interacting with the entries online while offering additional information when downloaded for further work.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mentioned-names\">Mentioned Names</h2>\n\n<p>These are the records of people mentioned in others’ entries. More than four-fifths of the traveler entries have at least one mentioned name. There are 24,234 records for mentioned names, totaling 6,502 unique names. Of these mentioned names, 4,323 are other travelers with an Explorer Entry ID. The top three most mentioned names are <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3169\">Horace Mann</a> (1706-86, travel years 1732-3), who is mentioned in <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22mentionedNames%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Horace%20Mann%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">426 entries</a>; <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2219\">Sir William Hamilton</a>, who is mentioned in <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22mentionedNames%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Sir%20William%20Hamilton%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">243 entries</a>; and the Italian painter Pompeo Batoni, who is mentioned in <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22mentionedNames%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Batoni%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">209 entries</a>. Batoni, as an Italian, does not have an Entry ID. Of the top ten most mentioned, three are non-British and thus lack an Entry ID: following Batoni are Stosch (158 entries) and Cardinal Albani (114 entries). To find a woman, users must scroll down to two painters, both non-British and with no Entry ID: at number twelve on the mentioned names list is <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22mentionedNames%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22or%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Angelica%20Kauffman%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">Angelica Kauffman</a> (mentioned in ninety-eight entries), and at number fifteen is Rosalba Carriera (<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22mentionedNames%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22or%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Rosalba%20Carriera%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">with eighty-seven mentions</a>). The first woman traveler with an Entry ID listed is <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3395\">Lady Montagu</a> at number nineteen (<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/explore/%7B%22mentionedNames%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22or%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Lady%20Mary%20Wortley%20Montagu%22%7D%5D%7D%7D\">with seventy-five mentions</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Most of the mentioned people without an Entry ID remain unidentified, but they serve as a reminder of the richness of the world of travel encountered by the British and Irish in Italy. In the Explorer, the mentioned names are displayed on both the Explore and Search pages, as well as on the individual entry pages. On the Explore page, in the search box that lists all mentioned names, the names of mentions without an Entry ID are marked by an asterisk. For each traveler entry, this data appears in the left-hand column. Mentions with an Entry ID are listed in black mouseover text displaying a preview of their entry, followed by a quotation mark as a blue actionable link leading to a list of entries sharing that mention. Mentions without an Entry ID are listed in black italic font. In the tabular download, this data appears in the “Travelers” table divided into two columns: the “mentionedNamesWithEntryID” column contains names with an Entry ID, while those with no Entry ID are in the column “mentionedNamesWithNoEntryID.” In both cases, the full names are given, separated by commas. An additional column, titled “IDmatchesForMentionedNamesWithEntryID,” contains all the Entry ID numbers, separated by commas.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"travel-data\">Travel Data</h1>\n\n<p>These are the records in the Explorer database documenting the places and dates of the journeys undertaken by the 6,007 travelers. This is essential data; it is the reason for the database’s very existence, given that in this prosopography of travelers, “having traveled to Italy” is the defining quality for an individual’s inclusion. For example, the <em>Dictionary</em> included twenty-six travelers merely on the basis that they were known to have traveled to Italy, with no further specification of place or date. The Explorer extended inclusion on the basis of travel even further by counting those born in Italy to travelers. In the Explorer, the travel data is immediately searchable in the two fields of “travel place” and “travel date.” Beyond this simplicity of search interfaces, though, exists the largest and most complex of the database’s many data sets.</p>\n\n<p>The travel data contains 27,275 records structured into nineteen columns (if you look at it in a Google Sheet, for example)—more than any other dimension. This complexity was necessary to transform the paragraph of semistructured travel information in the print <em>Dictionary</em> into a legible and manageable structure that could accommodate the concept of travel to the size, variety, and uncertainty of the travelers’ data. Travel is about movement, and this is represented in the database by putting information about time in relation to information about space. Both these categories possess, for each traveler, some measure of absence and inconsistency, and especially when it comes to travel dates, uncertainty is intrinsic to much of the historical record. The structure into which the data is formalized in the Explorer is designed to facilitate a variety of uses—from representation to visualization and download—and thus support further research. To explain this structure, first it is important to understand the distinction between Tours and Visits.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tours\">Tours</h2>\n\n<p>A tour constitutes the combined records of locations and dates that represent a traveler’s single journey to Italy. The tour data consists of a “tourIndex” and tour dates. The tourIndex is a numeric value assigned to each tour a traveler has taken in chronological order, starting with “1” and increasing sequentially. The number of travel records contained in a single tour varies greatly, but all travel records belong to a tour, and every traveler in the Explorer database has at least one tour. Even the travelers with no information about dates and places are recorded with a tourIndex of one, with zeros as date values and “Italy” given as the location. Most entries have only one tour (5,192), less than one-tenth of them have two, and fewer still have a tourIndex of three or more.<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup> Those with the most tours stretch the definition of <em>Grand Tourist</em>. In fact, the highest tourIndex numbers (nine to twenty) accompany those entries under a single surname belonging to multiple travelers about whom so little is known that they cannot be individualized; they do not represent tours undertaken by the same, singular person.<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup> The two rare individual travelers with eight tours are the Jacobite leader <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3192\">George Keith, 9th Earl of Marischal</a> (1693–1778), who, after his exile, is documented visiting Italy eight times between 1720 and 1778; and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2321\">Dr. James Hay</a> (d. 1746), a bear leader (or tour guide) who undertook eight tours from 1704 to 1734, each one with a different charge. Among those with the most tours, one more fitted to the typical Grand Tourist profile (while again stretching the definition of <em>tourist</em>) is the <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/587\">4th Earl of Bristol and Bishop of Derry</a> (1730–1803), who traveled six times to Italy, beginning in 1765 and ending with his death near Rome in 1803. He spent almost as much time in Italy as he did in England.</p>\n\n<p>The temporal data for tours is also numeric, expressing the beginning and ending years of a tour as “tourStart” and “tourEnd,” respectively. Start and end dates each consist of two data points (a “from” and a “to” date) to accommodate a handful of cases in which uncertainty about a start or end date was resolved using a year range; for example, the <em>Dictionary</em> entry for Richard Wilson says “it is not clear when Wilson left Italy” and gives the date as “1756/7,” which, in turn, is recorded in the Explorer data as “tourEndFrom 1756” to “tourEndTo 1757.” These tour dates express a tour’s duration, and for some travelers, this length can also stretch the meaning of a “tour.” Among the travelers with longest tours—viewed more easily in the dot chart by sizing for travel length—are long-term residents and many actually born in Italy, such as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2563\">Cosimo Hugford (fl. 1729–56)</a>. The tourIndex number, together with the tourStart and tourEnd dates, differentiates the travel data by tour, as well as representing travel length in the dot-chart visualization. On an individual traveler’s entry, each respective tour and its details are listed on the right-hand side of the page under an animated minimap visualization of tour visits. In the tabular download, this data appears in the “Travelers_Itineraries” table, in the column “tourIndex,” “tourStartYear,” and “tourEndYear.” In the Stanford Digital Repository, data includes also the few instances of ranges for the start and end of tours.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visits\">Visits</h2>\n\n<p>These are the individual records of stops comprising a tour, each record centering on a place and time of visit. The structure of this data is built around an arrival date and a departure date for a certain location. In the tabular download, this data occupies nine columns in the “Travelers_Itineraries” table. The first (“placeOfVisit”) contains the placename of the visit location; the following three (“visitStartYear,” “visitStartMonth,” “visitStartDay”) contain the data for the arrival date as available; the next three (“visitEndYear,” “visitEndMonth,” “visitEndDay”) contain what is recorded of the departure date; and the last column contains any markers accompanying the dates in the <em>Dictionary</em>. In the Explorer’s Explore and Search pages, the search fields “travel places” and “travel dates” open up the investigation of the travelers’ journeys.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travel-place\">Travel Place</h2>\n\n<p>These are the records, as string data, of the <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/map\">places visited by travelers</a>. There are 431 locations in the database. Of this total, the great majority of travel places, almost two-thirds, are located in Italy. Of the 150 locations recorded outside Italy, many are in England (either places of departure or return); others are on the route to Italy (countries that must be crossed to journey from Britain to the Italian peninsula by land); and still others represent tour segments beyond the peninsula in the Mediterranean and farther afield. The records are drawn as found in the <em>Dictionary</em>. There is no consistency of scale: travelers are recorded as having visited specific cities, countries, regions, and sites (“Piedmontese Frontier” and “Crossing the Alps” are recorded among places of travel). When two different versions of the same placename are recorded, they both appear in the data (for example, both Trento and Trent or Anzio and Antium). The data includes coordinates for georeferencing each location, whether the location is within the Italian peninsula or without and, for Italian places, the name of the eighteenth-century historical state in which they were located. This location data in the Explorer can be searched in the travel place field of the search and explore pages. It animates the minimap visualization on individual traveler entries and the map view on the visualization page. And it can be downloaded in tabular form, where one finds it on the “Travelers_Itineraries” table.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travel-date\">Travel Date</h2>\n\n<p>These are the records, a mix of numeric and string data, of the time spent by travelers in each visited place, and they are organized around arrival and departure dates. Each record contains a day, month, and year of both arrival and departure. This structure is built around the concept of duration: when the arrival day, month, and year coincide with that of departure, the visit is for one day or less—the minimum afforded by the data structure. When the arrival and departure dates differ, this difference yields the visit duration. But the incomplete records present challenges as far as measuring duration. In addition to the travelers lacking all temporal information, these visit dates contain large gaps. The day is missing from more than half of the 27,275 visit date records; indeed, 15,043 visits have no start day while 15,560 visits have no end day listed. The month is missing for around 8 percent of the records; 1,978 visit-date records have no start month, and 1,953 do not have an end month. In addition to these gaps, many temporal records contain varied qualifications. Just over a quarter of them contain markers qualifying the meaning of the numeric expression of the dates. A few qualifications, such as “departed,” “arrived,” or “returned” add specificity to the date information, but by and large the markers add uncertainty. The most common are “by” (in 3,066 records) and “-” (in 1,573 records), and the rest of markers—including “before,” “after,” “?,” and “c.,”—all attest to traveler visit dates that cannot be confirmed as certain.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> And even with good date records for two different locations, what should one assume about time spent at either one or in between? In the Explorer, the travel dates search function is designed to work only for month or year to avoid the illusion of precision contained in any date given down to the specificity level of an exact day. Moreover, the decision was made to systematically err on the side of inclusion. When there is uncertainty about where to place a traveler at a specific time in between two subsequent visited places, the Explorer does not hesitate to show that traveler in both. This runs against the logic of accuracy—of course, one cannot be in two places at the same time—but also allows for the possible significance of that traveler’s presence at either place, in terms of the connections or experiences they might have had there. In the individual traveler entry, the display of travel data in the right-hand column includes markers to reveal any known uncertainties; for the same reason, the markers are included in the downloaded data. Note also that a larger dot on the animated minimap might in some cases represent uncertainty, not a longer stay. Much care is needed when exploring and analyzing the data: attending to the gaps and uncertainties must be part of the process of understanding both individuals’ travels and larger travel patterns.</p>\n\n<center><h2>* * *</h2></center>\n\n<p>All data can be quickly downloaded on one’s computer and manipulated, analyzed, and visualized however one wishes. There will be many new and unexpected uses to which the data will be put, including the transformation of its categories.

The complex set of relations between the dimensions required devising three different tables for the download. In each of these three tables, every row holds one traveler entry and a few data points that repeat in all tables for ease of reference (such as the Entry ID, gender, traveler name, and biographical data). The first table, named “Travelers,” contains mainly static biographical data, such as parents’ names, places and dates of birth and death, as well as the indexical data (sources and mentioned names). The second table, “Travelers_Life_Events,” contains more dynamic biographical details, such as marriages, occupations and posts, and exhibits, all of which require columns for additional details (such as places and dates). The third table, “Travelers_Itineraries,” contains the travel data and is the most complex and uniquely figured of the three.

Tolkien’s <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, “not all those who wander are lost.”<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Indeed, as the recent brouhaha over the “wanderlust gene” DRD4-7R testifies, travel is a constant of human experience inflected in myriad ways by history, literature, and life—from the Aboriginal walkabout and the Homeric epics through the Jungian archetype of “the wanderer” to Tripadvisor.com and Ibiza stag parties.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> People travel to eat, to learn, and to conquer. They travel in search of architectural inspiration, for reasons of health, and simply because destinations were “there,” in Edmund Hillary’s felicitous formulation. Within this swath of human history, my interest lies with a particular <em>kind</em> of purposeful travel that I would define as “economic.” By this I do not mean frugal or “low-cost” or, for that matter, more permanent migration in search of a livelihood but travel for the purpose of improving the management of the material world—theoretically or practically, individually or collectively—more the Jesuit François Xavier d’Entrecolles discovering the secrets of Chinese porcelain in 1712 than, say, Ryanair.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> Economic journeys are, by default, emulative in aspiration if not in practice, as they are driven by the desire to discover better ways of doing and thinking in the economic sphere—not to mention to establish commercial linkages and networks. Such travels represent a crucial vector of globalization both past and present.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In the wake of East Timor’s new independence in 2002, for example, future Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri embarked on a global tour of “relevant” countries, ranging from Singapore to Nauru to Norway, to “learn from their experiences” and choose which one to emulate as a model of national political economy.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> A decade later, the Wenzhou businessman Sun Jian decided to fly to Lagos, Nigeria, after having considered everything from Bangladesh to Uzbekistan, because he had heard of opportunities there for outsourcing of Chinese manufacturing.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> These leaders’ modes of travel, one informed by macro- and the other by microeconomic concerns, harken back to the origins of international commerce and communication itself, to the conceptual beginnings of what we today call globalization.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> Examples of such economic tours are bountiful, stretching back into the dimmest eons of recorded history; eighteenth-century Europe positively brimmed with them.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> Indeed, the mythical “Grand Tour” in early modern Europe, of which these forms of instructive travel represent a woefully neglected aspect, has come to be seen as one of the cardinal institutions of the Enlightenment.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Scholars have recently called for a broader analysis of the Grand Tour, including, among other things, the women and children, servants and middlemen, foreigners and Italians among whom wealthy young Britons traveled. Though I am principally interested in the role of travel in early modern political economy, this essay contributes to expanding the historical parameters of Grand Tourism.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> I have explored elsewhere how the theories and practices of countries that “forged ahead,” to quote the Stanford economist Moses Abramowitz, were emulated in Europe through the medium of translation. Relatedly, I would argue that another type of “Grand Tour” emerged in the eighteenth century, in which travelers visited countries of similar or more advanced economic development and geopolitical standing for both technological and governmental inspiration—to emulate, in short, foreign best practices.<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup> The exercise of collecting strategic intelligence abroad had, of course, been a primary task of spies and ambassadors in early modern Europe, but a broader and more diverse set of travelers came to carry out this activity over the course of the eighteenth century. As the statesman, intellectual, and future 117th Doge of Venice Marco Foscarini put it in a 1742 ambassadorial report from Turin, one of the primary purposes of such accounts had historically been not merely to record events but to survey the trade networks, industries, and armies of different countries. Yet, “as these became familiar with the passing of time, and common knowledge because of the new facility of travel, which rendered it more frequent, and because of the infinite number of published books comprehensively treating of these issues, one has, not without reason, abandoned this form of report over the past century and reduced it to a kind of particular history containing the maxims, councils, and arcane origins of the things that took place during the duration of any given Ambassadorship.”<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The increasing frequency of travel, along with the exploding volume of publications in early modern Europe, changed the economy of intelligence on the continent, as a far wider spectrum of travelers and thinkers turned to questions of political economy and accumulated insights became common knowledge.<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup> Yet Foscarini insisted that travel could still offer strategic insights into the economic administration and economic systems of competing polities, even offering “perfect examples to imitate.”<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> Like textual translation, travel thus remained one of the early modern period’s principal vehicles of both international emulation and the standardization of best practices in the Western world, not to mention, in some cases, its transoceanic connections.<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> “The subject of Finances,” the future US president John Adams mused, could be learned only “from books or from Travel.”<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup> For similar reasons, his fellow founder and future President <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2667\">Thomas Jefferson</a> (1743–1826, travel year 1787) visited Piedmont in 1787 as part of his Grand Tour to study rice-growing practices. Like many contemporary traveling collectors, Jefferson acquired rare books in Italy, including a “copy of Polybius, the best edition,” but he readily admitted that “I scarcely got into classical ground . . . in architecture, painting, sculpture, I found much amusement; but more than all in their agriculture, many objects of which might be adopted with us to great advantage.”<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> Though <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2667\">Jefferson</a> indulged in many of the activities of the stereotypical Grand Tourist, his itinerary was fundamentally inflected by exigencies of political economy.</p>\n\n<p>Macro- and microeconomic interests sometimes overlapped during what one might call “Economic Grand Tours,” as was the case when the Milanese merchant and large-scale textile manufacturer Antonio Greppi traveled most of Europe, not merely in search of business opportunities but to familiarize himself with the theoretical study of international political economy.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup> Direct experience lent authority in economic affairs, as the Abruzzo adventurer Troiano Odazi proved when he successfully advertised his extensive travels when seeking a professorship in political economy at the University of Naples.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup> The Germanic ideal of <em>Bildung</em> so essential to the Grand Tour was, after all, pursued for individual as well as societal ends.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> Even the aesthetic language that Grand Tourists habitually employed to describe sublime vistas of Roman ruins and bucolic bliss found economic expression in some cases. When the Milanese patrician and scholar Alessandro Verri first visited England, for example, he marveled at the <em>bellissima veduta</em> not of Dover’s white cliffs but rather of London along the banks of the Thames, “covered with merchant ships, which form a forest of trees and another city on the sea.”<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The Grand Tour Explorer provides a remarkable tool for considering the continental experiences of travelers from what was by many accounts the world’s most advanced economy, Britain, as they ventured to Italy, a onetime seat of commercial power in Europe then in relative decline.<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> Yet, while the Explorer helps visualize and analyze the British Grand Tour to Italy in new ways, it also exemplifies some of the pitfalls of applying digital tools in the humanities. By mentioning this, I do not intend to diminish the value of such scholarship; rather, I mean to contribute to furthering the ways in which old scholarship and new technologies can interact and such digital projects can truly benefit the humanities.</p>\n\n<p>The Explorer retains many of the cornucopian qualities of its source, <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy, 1701–1800</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Archive by John Ingamells (1997). The latter was the work of a large editorial team led by Ingamells in order to engage with the vast personal archive of the British collector and art historian Sir Brinsley Ford.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup> The project of amassing the <em>Dictionary</em> was by necessity eclectic, even quixotic, but it produced a unique treasure trove of information regarding the British Grand Tour to Italy in the age of Enlightenment or, perhaps more appropriately, of contemporary British, Irish, and American travel to Italy. British visitors to Italy might or might not have made the list, depending on availability and convenience of materials, not to mention personal interest. They might be blessed with pages of text or relegated to cursory sentences (though the <em>Dictionary</em> identified a <em>very</em> large number of even cursory travelers). Needless to say, the editorial team only recorded itineraries of which they were certain. This led to a number of travelers “teleporting” around Italy as evidenced through fleeting appearances of names and places in archival or published sources. No Grand Tourist could <em>only</em> have visited landlocked Florence in the eighteenth century, no matter how attractive its institutional reforms and relative development were to contemporary travelers.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> It might even be argued that the <em>Dictionary</em> could only be so rich and varied because of what it neglected. As Orlando Pescetti put it in his <em>Proverbi italiani</em>, rendered famous by Voltaire, “the best is the enemy of the good.”<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> In this, the Explorer has walked a fine line, maintaining the <em>Dictionary</em>’s original underlying structures, while also making them more transparent and increasing accessibility to its rich content.</p>\n\n<p>Ford, Ingamells, and their collaborators did <em>not</em> plan on their work being transformed into an easily accessible database. This is clear when considering, for example, the defining terms with which many of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entries begin, which the Explorer has organized in the category of “Employments and Identifiers.” Perhaps only a lone British “editor of Shakespeare” and a solitary “bear leader” really ventured to Italian shores in the eighteenth century—though if one were to substitute “bear leader” with the term <em>tutor</em> or <em>traveling tutor</em>, the number swells to four—but it is hard to believe that only one solitary traveler was a “dilettante poet,” one an “amateur scientist,” and only one, rather implausibly, warranted the qualifier “miscreant.”<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> Ingamells cared first and foremost (one is tempted to say singularly) about what Ford had called “matters connected with the arts, patronage [and] collecting,” yet he called only one lonely voyager an “art critic”; boding poorly for subjects he cared for not at all.<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> Similarly, though focusing on British travelers, even for the period following the War of Independence (1775–83), he continued to list several Americans. And can we really be certain that <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/508\">William Bosville</a> (1745–1813, travel year 1779) was the British Grand Tour’s <em>only</em> “bon vivant” and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4536\">John Hall Stevenson</a> (1718–85, travel year 1753) its token “hedonist,” rather than the other way around?<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup> The Explorer illustrates how the <em>Dictionary</em>’s categories were literary in many cases rather than simply analytical. It also shows how, in extrapolating data from a different medium, one risks codifying the tentative and impressionistic. Ingamells, after all, wished for the book to be “readable” and—somewhat lethally for an analytical database—to embrace “a certain variety of style.”<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup> To a scholar of the Grand Tour, the classification of the physician and tour guide <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2321\">Dr. James Hay</a> (d. 1746, travel years 1704–6, 1707–9, 1711–12, 1715, 1718–19, 1720, 1722–23, 1729–34) as “bear leader,” for example, is a witty implicit reference to Pier Leone Ghezzi’s c. 1725 caricature <em>Dr. Hay as Bear-Leader</em> and the colloquial eighteenth-century nickname for a traveling tutor (fig. 1). But it also risks suggesting Hay was touring with actual bears—also an early modern practice—around the ruins of ancient Rome rather than with wealthy British youths.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../reinert-figure-1.png\" id=\"fig1\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1\">\n\nFig. 1.

Its only “economist” was the Irish banker and writer <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/790\">Richard Cantillon</a> (1680–1734, travel years 1724–25); its “political economist” was Adam Smith’s nemesis <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4530\">Sir James Steuart</a> (1712–80, travel years 1739, 1758); the lone “agricultural writer” Ingamells detected was <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4859\">Jethro Tull</a> (1674–1741, travel years c. 1711–14); and his “agriculturist” was <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5281\">Arthur Young</a> (1741–1820, travel year 1789).<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup><a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4664\">John Symonds</a> (1730–1807, travel years 1765–71), Regius Professor of Modern History in Cambridge for nearly four decades, was the only tourist identified as an “agronomist, and miscellaneous writer” in the <em>Dictionary</em>, though not as a “historian” or, for that matter, a “lawyer,” which he also was.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> The Welsh Major-General Henry Lloyd, one of the most Münchausen-like figures of his century, appeared both as “soldier and economist <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1638\">Henry Humfrey [<em>sic</em>] Evans</a>” in Parma in 1769, and as the “mercenary, military historian” <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2984\">Gen. Henry Humphrey Evans Lloyd</a>, who traveled widely through Genoa, Leghorn/Livorno, Milan, Rome, Vaprio d’Adda, and Venice.<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup> In the digital version of the Explorer, such redundancies can be swiftly located and resolved: Henry Lloyd’s two entries have been combined into one, for example. Moreover, the Explorer curates and adds new layers of navigation to the <em>Dictionary</em>’s text. The “Occupations &amp; Posts” categories now group the professions and interests of travelers in more searchable forms. Still, as a digital transformation of the original text, the Explorer’s data remains, so far, largely dependent on the information contained in the <em>Dictionary</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, Ford, Ingamells, and their team <em>did</em> take note of merchants, to the extent that the second single largest category in “Employments and Identifiers” after “painter” (165 entries) is “merchant” (157 entries). And if one adds the sundry variations of the term—“textile merchant,” “timber merchant,” “oriental merchant,” and “wine merchant”—as well as other “economic” occupations such as, in “Occupations &amp; Posts,” “banker,” “merchant banker,” “financier,” and, of course, “money lender,” in this case, the notorious <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2774\">John “Jew” King</a> (1753–1823, travel years 1785–1823)—one can create a list of 180 such “economic” Grand Tourists reaching Italy from Britain during the period scrutinized by Ingamells; a similar number, incidentally, results from adding up the categories of “painter” (165), “portrait painter” (8), and “watercolourist” (4).<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> Both clusters are, in any case, limited compared to the 6,007 total entries in the Explorer, some of which were cross-referenced variations of names, but sizable in relation to the 914 travelers for whom Ingamells found “Employments and Identifiers,” or even the 2,020 that we end up with if we add those with identified “Occupations &amp; Posts.” Adopting a bird’s-eye view for the occasion, a map of all recorded travels of these individuals reveals a logical pattern.</p>\n\n<p>As a baseline of analysis, most Grand Tourists with an employment identifier, occupation, or post visited Italian cities in the same order that the raw total did: Rome (1,371), distantly trailed by Florence (926) and Venice (812), then Naples (810), Turin (476), Leghorn/Livorno (441), Padua (404), and Genoa (339), then a broad swath of locations from Trieste to Sicily (fig. 2). Many travelers reached Italy through France and the Alps, arriving in Savoy Turin. Genoa and Leghorn/Livorno’s prominent places in the second tier of cities might also reflect geographical necessities of travel at the time (for more on this, see <a href=\"/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival\">Rachel Midura</a>’s essay). One can only assume that Milan would have ranked higher in an aggregate map of Grand Tourists from northern Europe, and Trieste would be ranked higher in the case of travelers from the East.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-2\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../reinert-figure-2.png\" id=\"fig2\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap2&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap2\">\n\nFig. 2. Travels of Grand Tourists with &ldquo;Employment or Identifier&rdquo; or &ldquo;Occupations &amp; Posts&rdquo; information. Note the concentration of travelers in the major cities of Rome, Florence, Venice, and Naples. Points sized by the number of travelers.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Focusing on the subset of 177 “painters,” “portrait painters,” and “watercolourists,” as identified in the “Employers and Identifiers,” changes things somewhat (fig. 3). Unsurprisingly, Rome (158 travelers) remains the premier destination on the Grand Tour, with Florence a distant second (68). These are followed by Naples (63) and Venice (43), closely trailed by Bologna (31) and Parma (27). Only around a third of these travelers voyaged south of Rome and, of these, even fewer outside of Naples, though it is remarkable that more visited Naples than Venice. Though this would require sustained archival work to ascertain, it is tempting to guess that the trips by this subset to many of the smaller cities reflected wishes to visit specific places of beauty or artworks on display. As William Hazlitt so famously, if wrongheadedly, derided his countrymen, “the English abroad turn out of their way to visit every pettifogging, huckstering object that they can see better at home.”<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../reinert-figure-3.png\" id=\"fig3\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap3\">\n\nFig. 3.

Points sized by the number of unique travelers.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Turning to the 180 travelers on the “economic” Grand Tour, a similar number of entries now reveals a rather different set of itineraries (fig. 4). The Eternal City has, for the first time, been supplanted as the premier destination by Leghorn/Livorno (98), followed by Naples (45), Venice (34), and Rome (31). Destinations farther south were generally neglected by the itineraries of such “economic” Grand Tourists, who focused squarely on the country’s center and north, with comparably high frequencies of visits to the old economic core of the peninsula from Turin down to Genoa, and through Milan to Venice. Strikingly, these travelers were far less likely to be recorded in smaller cities on the Grand Tour than were artists. The Danish cameralist Peter Christian Schumacher, who explicitly had set out on a Grand Tour to study European practices of political economy, justified his decision not to visit Naples: “it holds so little influence in the European system that it cannot be of particularly dire importance [<em>magtpaaliggende</em>] what system they have.”<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../reinert-figure-4.png\" id=\"fig4\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap4&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\nFig. 4.

The former city-states of northern Italy continued to play a role in the commerce of the continent throughout the eighteenth century, and Leghorn/Livorno remained an important <em>entrepôt</em> throughout the period, particularly for British interests, owing to the prevalence of the Levant Company. Frequently the first port of call after London for ships heading East, and a “great pivot” for British trade in the Mediterranean, Leghorn/Livorno had long established itself as the main “funnel” for Turkish trade with Britain, France, and the Netherlands.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup> Leghorn/Livorno held a unique place among Italian cities in the imagination of the Grand Tour for being clean, modern, and built for the living rather than the dead—a space of bustling trade rather than of towering ruins.<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup> Far more British merchants and sailors visited Leghorn/Livorno than those identified in the <em>Dictionary</em>, of course (as observed by <a href=\"/scholars-essays/macdonald-harlequin-horsemanship\">Simon Macdonald</a>). But it remains interesting that the “Free Port” of Leghorn/Livorno—recently the subject of long-overdue scholarly attention in the English-speaking world—would play such an important role in the more traditional Grand Tour that was the primary focus of the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:40\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2984\">Henry Lloyd</a>’s version of the Grand Tour was, in many ways, characteristic of this kind of economic travel. Very much confined to the upper half of the Italian peninsula, his journeys were dictated by his career as an international spy and economic theorist, as well as by his friendship with members of the Milanese “Academy of Fisticuffs” (<em>Accademia dei pugni</em>), with whom he revolutionized the use of algebra and differential calculus in political economy (fig. 5).<sup id=\"fnref:41\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></sup> Lloyd traveled for reasons of international power politics and to learn about the science and discipline of political economy—itself repeatedly declared emblematic of the Enlightenment as such.<sup id=\"fnref:42\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../reinert-figure-5.png\" id=\"fig5\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap5&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap5\">\n\nFig. 5.

The maps demonstrate the diversity between Lloyd and Blackwell and the relative scarcity of data for Blaquiere.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>For an example of a more specifically mercantile-political sojourn, that of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/445\">Sir Lambert Blackwell</a> (1665–1727, travel years 1689–1705)—merchant and Britain’s first consul to Leghorn/Livorno; later ambassador to Venice, Florence, and Genoa; and director of the South Sea Company—is representative, as his political appointments closely mirrored British strategic and commercial interests on the peninsula. Though hardly evocative of the Grand Tour as commonly understood, Ingamells’ fleeting and melancholy mention of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/459\">Lewis Blaquiere</a> (1722–54, travel years 1744–54) is also illustrative of countless other British merchants who escaped mention in the <em>Dictionary</em>: “BLAQUIERE, LEWIS (c. 1722–54), merchant. -1744–54 Leghorn. With several other members of the British Factory at Leghorn, he signed a memorial in May 1744. He was presumably the Lewis Blaquiere who died in Leghorn on 3 August 1754, aged 32, and who was buried in the Protestant cemetery.”<sup id=\"fnref:43\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/459\">Blaquiere</a> came to Leghorn/Livorno on business and died there a decade later. Predictably, the map of Blaquiere’s Grand Tour matches perfectly those of a number of alphabetized “merchant” entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>, all the way down to <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5243\">Francis Wyatt</a> (travel year 1704), and presumably numerous others.<sup id=\"fnref:44\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></sup> But, to quote my old friend US Customs and Border Protection Declaration Form 6059B, “Was the primary purpose of this trip business?”<sup id=\"fnref:45\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></sup> How relevant to the institution of the Grand Tour is Blaquiere’s resounding “yes” to this question? In the case of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2667\">Jefferson</a>, his travels were clearly driven by purposes of both business and pleasure, and the idea of an “Economic Grand Tour” thus makes a certain degree of sense, but Blaquiere?</p>\n\n<p>Accepting John Brewer’s basic ideal of the Grand Tour as “an educational rite of passage,” often in preparation of “public duties,” an employee on the job abroad such as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/459\">Blaquiere</a> may actually have had more in common with his contemporary <em>milordi Inglesi</em> than one might first think.<sup id=\"fnref:46\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></sup> For there existed a venerable European tradition of merchants and tradesmen undergoing similar rites of passage on the road to acquire status in their professions. The British merchant stationed in Leghorn/Livorno might not ultimately have been that different from a prerevolutionary French journeyman, a stereotypical Hanseatic apprentice stuck in Bergen for a decade before returning home to a more important desk job, or, for that matter, a noble Christ Church graduate preparing for a position in British government.<sup id=\"fnref:47\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></sup> Inflections of this practice—quintessentially evident even in the aforementioned Aboriginal walkabout—continue to characterize modern business and government institutions alike in large parts of the world.</p>\n\n<p>If we focus instead on the subset of thirty-seven Grand Tourists in the “Occupations &amp; Posts” category of “Finance and Trade,” the resulting map presents a different picture (fig. 6). This subset includes the sort of powerful economic actors whom contemporaries began to call “capitalists,” such as <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2850\">David Digues La Touche</a> (1729–1817, travel years 1753–54, 1781, 1787–93), the first governor of the Bank of Ireland. Among these tourists, Rome (19 travelers) reclaims its throne, followed by Venice (15), Florence (14), and Leghorn/Livorno (11). Not surprisingly, those who <em>did</em> venture South of Italy’s financial centers did so for the reason one might expect from historiography. La Touche, for example, seemingly traveled to Capua and Naples as a “collector,” rather than on business.<sup id=\"fnref:48\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:48\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Turning to the larger occupational subset of “Statesmen and Political Appointees” (884), the resulting map is in turn more reminiscent of the pattern revealed by the overall Explorer data (fig. 7). It seems improbable that only <em>one</em> of these travelers visited Pompeii, but, generally speaking, these numbers highlight the degree to which recent scholarship has exaggerated the importance of Naples relative to northern Italian cities as a destination for British travelers and even more egregiously that of the rest of southern Italy(fig. 8). It remains striking that, at the time of this writing, the search for “eighteenth-century Naples” has 574 hits on Google Scholar, vastly overshadowing the equivalent searches for Florence (234), Genoa (52), Milan (178), Livorno (117; Leghorn has 2), and Turin (221), though all are dwarfed by Venice (1,450) and particularly Rome (1,990). A more specific search for “Grand Tour” in conjunction with the names of various cities is less informative, simply because most works on the Grand Tour mention a host of names somewhere in their texts, but the difference between Naples (8,580) and Leghorn/Livorno (973) still serves to illustrate the divergence between historical travel and historiographical emphasis.<sup id=\"fnref:49\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:49\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-6\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"../reinert-figure-6.png\" id=\"fig6\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig7&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap67&apos;), true)\" /> </a> <a name=\"figure-7\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"../reinert-figure-7.png\" id=\"fig7\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig6&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap67&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap67\">\n\nFigs. 6 and 7.

In the eighteenth century, English books mentioned Naples more frequently than English travelers actually visited the city, based on the Explorer, particularly in comparison to other cities. Leghorn/Livorno was more important to English trade and travel than the aggregate book history as channeled by a Google Ngram would suggest. If nothing else, these different perspectives on the Grand Tour made possible by digital history suggest more expansive approaches to different cities than have been traditionally employed.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-9\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"../reinert-figure-9.png\" id=\"fig9\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig10&apos;),\n getElementById(&apos;cap910&apos;))\" />\n </a> <a name=\"figure-10\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"../reinert-figure-10.png\" id=\"fig10\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig9&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap910&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap910\">\n\nFigs. 9 and 10.

Furthermore, it indicates a direction for more extensive archival work to answer the question of why, exactly, economically interested individual British travelers chose particular destinations. Finally, the visualizations made possible by the use of digital tools suggest that significant historiographical revisionism is in order, as the center of gravity for British travelers to Italy matched the centers of economic activity on the peninsula far more closely than recent scholarship would suggest, even, as the aggregate data reveals, in the case of stereotypically aristocratic travelers seeking <em>Bildung</em> through exposure to the material remnants of antiquity.<sup id=\"fnref:52\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></sup> The Grand Tour was a protean institution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the shifting geography of which reflected changing spaces of cultural importance in Europe.<sup id=\"fnref:53\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:53\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></sup> Though the Enlightenment fervor for exoticism, antiquarianism, collecting, and bric-a-brac generally has been studied in recent decades, travel was also one of the most important vectors for worldlier processes of international commerce, communication, competition, and emulation at the time. The greatest difference between the traditional scholarly Grand Tour and its economic variation, however, might be that while the former looked to the past, the latter looked resolutely to the future, inventing rather than confirming established tropes.<sup id=\"fnref:54\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:54\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">54</a></sup> Journeying for business and political economy remains a vast, transhistorical phenomenon, of which the economic tourism traceable through the Grand Tour Explorer must be considered an important subset and the Grand Tour itself a particularly vibrant chapter in the timeless flow of goods, people, and ideas that forms our past and our present.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h1>\n\n<p>This essay was prepared as part of Giovanna Cesarani’s Grand Tour Explorer project, and I am grateful to the participants at her Stanford conference of March 4–5, 2016, as well as to Steven L.

        "content"  : "<p>The Venetian Rosalba Carriera (1673–1757) was one of the most important female artists in Europe during the first half of the eighteenth century (fig. 1). Her patrons included foreign collectors, artists, and members of the clergy, as well as fellow Venetians and other Italians. Royals across Europe sought her work: Frederick IV, King of Denmark; Johann Wilhelm von der Platz, Elector Palatine; and Frederick Augustus II, Prince-Elector of Saxony (also known as Augustus III, King of Poland), who amassed more than one hundred pastels by Carriera for a gallery he dedicated to her in Dresden.<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Carriera’s studio, which she maintained in her home on the Grand Canal, was an important stop on the Grand Tour. Her clients sought portraits of themselves, depictions of various types of allegories, or portraits of Venetian women famous for their beauty or musical talent (fig. 2).<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-12\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../sama-figure-23.png\" id=\"fig1\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1\">\n\nFigs. 1 and 2.

One of Carriera’s most ardent supporters was <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1035\">Christian Cole</a> (fl. 1697–1735, travel years 1701–5, 1707–14, 1715), secretary to the <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3158\">English Ambassador to Venice</a>. In a letter to the artist alerting her to the imminent arrival of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1833\">Sir Thomas Frankland</a> (c. 1683–1747, travel years 1704–5), Cole noted that his compatriot “would not like to pass through Venice without seeing the Signora Rosalba [who is] justly esteemed an ornament of Italy, and [the] premier painter of Europe.”<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> When traveling through Venice, British travelers also acted as couriers for the artist, ferrying letters, books, pastel chalks, and works of art between Carriera and other friends and acquaintances; among these individuals who populate the Explorer, we can count Cole, Frankland, and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4868\">Thomas Turner</a> (travel years 1704–5). Still others—<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2658\">Peter Philip Jamineau</a> (travel years -1735–45) and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4657\">Owen Swiney</a> (1676–1754, travel years 1715–32)—acted as agents for Carriera, negotiating commissions and arranging for payment and deliveries. In short, Carriera’s career was tightly bound to the transactional world of the Grand Tour, and collectively, British travelers played a vital and multifaceted role in the artist’s work life (fig. 3).<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../sama-figure-1.png\" id=\"fig23\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap23&apos;), true)\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap23\">\n\nFig. 3. This visualization shows the names of eighty-one travelers in the Grand Tour Explorer who are associated with Rosalba Carriera, as well as the nature of their association(s) with her. The travelers were identified by using the &ldquo;free word search&rdquo; tool to locate entries containing &ldquo;Rosalba&rdquo; <i>or</i> &ldquo;Carriera.&rdquo; Close reading of the eighty-one entries was combined with information from additional sources to identify the types of association each traveler had with the artist, whether she appears in their correspondence or diaries, whether they are known to have sat for a portrait by her, or whether they commissioned a piece of her artwork. The different types of associations are indicated in different colors. This visualization gives a vivid impression of how many British travelers Carriera interacted with&mdash;and made portraits of&mdash;during her long career. Indeed, the Explorer data is almost certainly an undercount, owing both to the vagaries of the historical record and to the particularities of the making of John Ingamells&rsquo; <i>Dictionary</i> and its transformation into the virtual Explorer.

Download and explore <a href=\"https://purl.stanford.edu/yb732rj4564\">the data</a> behind this visualization.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>I came to the Grand Tour Explorer workshops as a literary scholar of Rosalba Carriera. My research focuses on the artist’s life and work in connection to literary and artistic circles of eighteenth-century Venice and Europe and highlights her networking with female contemporaries. Carriera’s vast correspondence with clients, fellow artists, family, and friends has been critical to my work. With few exceptions (including <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1035\">Cole</a>), British clients and acquaintances are mostly absent from this correspondence. I wondered what further information the Explorer could offer about the artist and her interactions with these individuals, beyond the connections already widely established by art historians. This seemed a particularly intriguing question because, as an Italian artist, Rosalba Carriera does not have an entry in the richly detailed <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells (1997). Consequently, information about Carriera cannot be found in one easily identifiable place; instead, references to her appear scattered throughout the entries of the <em>Dictionary</em>. The search power of the Explorer made it easy to gather these references: one inquiry using the “Free word search” tool with the terms <em>Rosalba</em> or <em>Carriera</em> elicited eighty-one entries—a promising start to a more detailed investigation. I decided to explore the database in tandem with Carriera’s correspondence, her work diary, and other primary sources to confirm or clarify details about her British clients and to see if I could discover new information. Pairing primary sources with the database’s digital-search capability was powerful: in some cases, it allowed me to trace connections between Carriera and British clients even when neither Carriera nor Venice were mentioned in the Explorer’s entries. In others, unexpected aggregations of travelers in the search results produced new questions and ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Searches of the database using specific dates and places can help confirm the identity of individuals whose names are illegible in manuscript sources. For example, on May 9, 1724, Carriera recorded in her work diary the visit to her studio of a “M.<sup>r</sup> Felo inglese” (fig. 4). A quick search of the Explorer using “Venice” and this specific date reveals that the British traveler <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1683\">Coulson Fellowes</a> (1696–1769, travel year 1724), was in and around Venice at this time. Even though Carriera is not mentioned in Fellowes’s entry, and despite the fact that his name is difficult to decipher in the primary source, we can confirm his identity. Since its publication in 1997, the print version of the <em>Dictionary</em> has been an important source for scholars seeking to resolve questions like the one regarding Fellowes and other Grand Tourists. However, the digital power of the Explorer allows a broad public to explore Carriera’s interactions with the British more quickly, easily, and creatively.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup></p>\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../sama-figure-4.png\" id=\"fig4\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap4&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\nFig. 4. Excerpt from Rosalba Carriera&rsquo;s work diary, where she recorded visits to her studio. The entry for May 9, 1724, notes a visit from a &ldquo;M.<sup>r</sup> Felo inglese.&rdquo; By searching the Explorer for that date and &ldquo;Venice&rdquo; (the location of Carriera&rsquo;s studio), it is possible to quickly confirm the identity of the individual as Coulson Fellowes, a British Grand Tourist. The searchability of Grand Tour data enabled by the Explorer makes identifications such as this much faster than before.

I also aim to provide a vade mecum of sorts for anyone wishing to navigate the expansive territories of the Explorer, particularly for those whose research focuses on the Italians or other Europeans with whom the British travelers interacted.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"rosalba-carriera\">Rosalba Carriera</h1>\n\n<p>Little is known about Carriera’s early life and artistic training.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> Most women who became successful artists had fathers, brothers, or husbands who were also artists. This was not the case for Carriera: her father worked as a government office clerk, she had no brothers, and she never married. She maintained her own studio, where her sisters Giovanna and Angela (until the latter’s marriage) worked as assistants and collaborators. After their father’s death, Rosalba—aged forty-six—became the head of the family household, continuing to live with and support her mother and younger sister Giovanna for the rest of their lives.</p>\n\n<p>By her late twenties, the Venetian artist had begun to make a name for herself throughout Europe. She received invitations to courts across Europe and left the lagoon city for three extended trips. The most important of these was an invitation to Paris, where she lived for a year (1720–21) with her mother and sisters in the home of the financier and collector Pierre Crozat. Much admired by fellow artists, as well as by royalty, she counted among her numerous clients Antoine Watteau and the young Louis XV. Back in Italy, two years later, in 1723, she was invited to the court of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, where she lived for about five months while she created portraits of the princesses of the Este family. In 1730, she traveled with her sister, Giovanna, to the court in Vienna where she worked for about three months, creating portraits of various members of the court, including the Dowager Empress Wilhelmina Amalia.</p>\n\n<p>Carriera’s talent was rewarded with special admission to academies of art in Italy and France, despite their regulations barring female members. In 1705, she was admitted to the Academy of St. Luke in Rome as a meritorious member rather than as a mere “honorary” member, as was typical for most women admitted to art academies (fig. 5).<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> In 1720, she became a member of two other academies: the Clementine Academy in Bologna and the prestigious Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Paris.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout her life, Carriera worked assiduously. She was an astute businesswoman, earned a good living, and invested her savings; she was frequently able to lend money to family members and friends in need. She also dedicated time to female apprentices; one of them, Felicita Sartori (1715–60), lived and worked in the Carriera home/studio for more than thirty years and made a name for herself as a miniaturist, pastellist, and engraver. Carriera worked into her early seventies—undergoing surgeries for cataracts, only partially successful, until blindness forced her to stop.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"miniatures-and-pastels\">Miniatures and Pastels</h1>\n\n<p>Early in her career, Carriera was renowned for her delicate miniature portraits and allegories in tempera, watercolor, or gouache on an ivory ground (figs. 5–7). She helped raise the status of miniature painting to a fine art by removing it from the purely decorative realm of snuff boxes. She was one of the first artists in Europe to bring the feel and texture of large paintings to the miniature form, and her innovative techniques influenced the evolution of the art of miniature painting over the course of the eighteenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> At first Carriera used the ivory bottoms or tops of snuff boxes (no longer attached or functioning as such) for her miniatures, but eventually she began to purchase small pieces of ivory and have them cut to size, usually in an oval form. She covered her miniatures with glass and mounted them in metal or tortoiseshell cases before sending them to her clients, who could display them in cabinets, keep them in coat pockets, or hang them from ribbons around their necks. Among the clients present in the Explorer who commissioned miniatures from Carriera are <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/707\">Richard Boyle Burlington</a> (1694–1753, travel years 1714–15), who bought twelve of them; <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/834\">Lucius Charles Cary</a> (1705–85, travel years 1724–25); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4632\">Mrs. Summers</a> (travel years c. 1700–1705); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4860\">William Murray, Marquess of Tullibardine</a> (1689–1746, travel years 1710, 1717); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4977\">Robert Walpole</a> (c. 1701–51, travel years 1722–23; fig. 6), <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1035\">Christian Cole</a>; and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3682\">William Osbaldeston</a> (1688–1766, travel years 1710–11; fig.7).</p>\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-57\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../sama-figure-57.png\" id=\"fig57\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap57&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap57\">\n\nFigs. 5&ndash;7.

About three-quarters of the roughly 440 works attributed to her are pastels.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> The Venetian artist helped transform pastel chalks from something used mostly for preliminary sketches to a respected and popular medium for portraiture. French and Italian artists who admired and were influenced by Carriera include Charles-Antoine Coypel, Maurice Quentin de LaTour, Giovanna Fratellini, Jean-Baptiste Perroneau, Pietro Rotari, Nicolas Vleughels, and Antoine Watteau. Among British artists who admired, owned, or copied her works, we may count <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2797\">George Knapton</a> (1698–1778, travel years 1725–33), <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3921\">Arthur Pond</a> (1701–58, travel years 1725–27), <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2446\">William Hoare</a> (1707–92, travel years 1728–37), Francis Cotes, and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4047\">Katherine Read</a> (1723–78, travel years 1751–53).<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup> The artist’s pastels were extremely popular among her clients, whether these were foreign royalty, Venetian patricians, or Grand Tourists. In fact, the majority of the individuals from the database who have some connection to Carriera sat for a pastel portrait or commissioned allegorical works in pastel. Some of the most well-known British Grand Tourists in the Explorer with pastel portraits by the Venetian artist are <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/543\">Gustavus Hamilton, 2nd Viscount Boyne</a> (1710–46, travel years 1730–31; fig. 8); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2956\">Henry Fiennes Clinton, 9th Earl of Lincoln</a> (1720–94, travel years 1739–41); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3185\">Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond</a> (1701–50, travel year 1721); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3305\">Charles Sackville Middlesex, 2nd Duke of Dorset</a> (1711–69, travel years 1731–33); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4469\">Joseph Spence</a> (1699–1768, travel years 1731–33, 1739–41); <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/5088\">Philip, 1st Duke of Wharton</a> (1698–31, travel years 1719, 1726, 1728; fig. 9); and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4129\">Lewis Watson, 2nd Earl of Rockingham</a> (c. 1714–45, travel years 1733–34).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-89\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../sama-figure-89.png\" id=\"fig89\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap89&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap89\">\n\nFigs. 8 and 9.

This strategy was highly successful with Grand Tourists who specifically requested pictures depicting mythological figures, allegorical figures, or portraits of beautiful Venetian women, as well as portraits of themselves. Her sets of the Four Seasons and the Four Elements were very popular, as were her renditions of Diana and Flora (figs. 10-12).<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1405\">Robert Dingley</a> (1710–81, travel years 1733–34), collector and future director of the Bank of England, wrote to Carriera from London in 1735, requesting a picture of a “pretty young country girl” in the guise of Winter, specifically “like the one in the cabinet of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4417\">Mr. (Joseph) Smith</a>” (c. 1674–1770, travel years c. 1700–1770). It is likely that Dingley had noticed this picture during his Italian tour in the personal collection of Smith, who spent most of his life in Venice as a merchant banker and as the British Consul from 1744 to 1760.

Her miniatures’ tiny sizes (ranging from c. 7 x 5cm to 15 x 10cm) meant they were easy to wear, carry, or send by post. Carriera’s pastels did not need the extensive drying time of oil paintings, and their generally moderate size (ranging from 30 x 25 to 70 x 50 cm) made them relatively easy to ship or, ideally, have hand-delivered through couriers and friends traveling to other cities.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"exploring-the-grand-tour-explorer-carrieras-connections-with-other-women\">Exploring the Grand Tour Explorer: Carriera’s Connections with Other Women</h1>\n\n<p>Most of the travelers that emerge from searching for Carriera in the Explorer are already known to scholars of the British Grand Tour. But the search results produce new groupings among her British interlocutors—leveling famous with less-well-known clients, acquaintances with friends, intermediaries with visitors to her studio. They therefore offer us a uniquely nuanced and textured view of Carriera’s Grand Tour connections.</p>\n\n<p>One way I attempted to harness the powers of the Explorer was to tap it for information regarding Rosalba Carriera’s connections with other women. When I used the “Free word search” term, and filtered for gender with search terms such as <em>woman</em>, <em>wife</em>, <em>widow</em>, <em>daughter</em>, <em>Mrs.</em>, etc., the database led me to two women: <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/621.1\">Elizabeth Eaton Broughton</a> (d. 1734, travel years 1691–34), whom we hear about through the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entry on her husband, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/621\">Hugh Broughton</a>, British Consul of Venice (d. 1716, travel years -1691–1716); and the pastellist, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4047\">Katherine Read</a>, sometimes referred to by contemporaries as “the present English Rosalba”<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> and one of the few women with her own entry in the original <em>Dictionary</em>. I was already familiar with Broughton and Read because of their (spare) presence in the Carriera correspondence. But because the Explorer search aggregated them into a single result, I noticed that they both highlighted difficulties Carriera experienced in working with the impresario <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4657\">Owen Swiney</a>, who acted as agent and intermediary between the artist and her British clients, handling commissions, deliveries, and payments.<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> I was therefore able to look at these women in a new way, appreciating their role as sources of information on Carriera as a businesswoman and considering further the artist’s place in a network of supportive women.<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Unlike many of the travelers in the Explorer database, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/621.1\">Elizabeth Eaton Broughton</a> was a long-term resident in Venice. From 1690 to 1716, she lived there in her role as wife of the <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/621\">British Consul</a>. After her husband’s passing, she remained in the lagoon city (or at least sojourned there) until her own death nearly twenty years later, in 1734.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> The two extant letters Broughton wrote to Carriera indicate that she was a close friend of the artist and her family and that she interacted with them in both English and Italian. One of the letters reflects a quotidian familiarity between the two women; in it, Broughton extends an invitation to Carriera’s sister Angela for a “country gallop a satterday in y.<sup>e</sup> afternoon” in Mestre, should weather permit such an outing.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/621.1\">Broughton</a> penned the other letter—in Italian—in 1721, soon after Carriera returned to Venice following the artist’s year away in Paris. Perhaps in part because Carriera was still reinserting herself into life and work in Venice, Broughton wrote in order to relay confidential information about current gossip regarding payments for Carriera’s paintings: “My dear friend, since <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4657\">Mr. Sueniy</a> has let all our compatriots know that he isn’t giving more than 15 sequins for the Portrait you made of Milord, I thought it a good idea to warn you, so that you can act accordingly and make sure you are well paid for the one of Mr. Ratley, and have no other regard than your own interest.” After penning the closing salutation, Broughton made sure to add, “I send this for your information and all of it must remain between us” (fig. 13).<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-13\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../sama-figure-13.png\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap13&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap13\">\n\nFig. 13.

We also know that her prices generally remained consistent throughout her career. Furthermore, Broughton—a well-informed and well-connected member of British Grand Tourist circles—clearly indicates that she thought Swiney was promoting insufficient remuneration of the artist.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Thirty-odd years later, in 1753, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4047\">Katherine Read</a> wrote in French to Carriera from Paris, after having recently visited the eighty-year old Venetian artist in her studio and having made her portrait. She noted that she was taking great pleasure in viewing works by Carriera at the Académie royale de peinture and in private collections. Since Read was about to return to London, she asked if she might be of service regarding some (unidentified) business with <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4657\">Swiney</a>. The impresario-agent appears at the center of the next extant letter from Read, which she wrote in 1756 after hearing from Carriera for the first time in a year (fig. 14).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-14\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../sama-figure-14.jpg\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap14&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap14\">\n\nFig. 14.

E’ vietata ogni ulteriore riproduzione con qualsiasi mezzo.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The lack of communication—and a rumor of the artist’s death—had led Read to mourn Carriera as “a friend and an artist without equal who had brought greater honor to her sex than had ever been done before.”<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup> This letter reveals that Read had been trying for nearly two years to help Carriera and Consul <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4417\">Joseph Smith</a> (in whose care Read had previously sent letters to Carriera) obtain money owed to them by the recently deceased Swiney. She had even consulted a friend who had transcribed a copy of Swiney’s last wishes, and she was told that the impresario had left everything to “Mademoiselle Woffington.”<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> Woffington, in turn, told Read that just before his death, Swiney claimed he owed the Venetian artist nothing. Read explains all of this to Carriera in her letter, saying that she hopes “with all my heart that you can recover your money,” but she is not optimistic.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The younger artist concludes her letter by expressing her desire to purchase one of Carriera’s works: a Madonna, “which I think I heard was your last work,” or a Cleopatra, “or another of your finest ideal heads,” whichever the artist would prefer to part with. She tells Carriera that she will pay whatever the artist wishes, and with her closing line she promises that she “will be more punctual than <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4657\">Swinnie</a>.”<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> Clearly, Carriera was still conducting business despite her blindness and advanced age, and British travelers were still active participants in her professional life.</p>\n\n<p>The letters of <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/621.1\">Broughton</a> and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4047\">Read</a> give us a brief behind-the-scenes look into the ways friends, artists, patrons, and agents navigated the waters of producing and selling art. Like the letter mentioned above from <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1405\">Robert Dingley</a> to Carriera, these missives also reflect the highly interconnected and at times secretive social networking among British travelers to Italy. When examined together, the three letters—written in English, French, and Italian—allow us to consider how Carriera interacted on a multilingual level with that network as a businesswoman. Were Broughton and Read writing to her simply as supportive friends? Or were they also writing as women seeking to protect another woman (artist) from being exploited by a man like <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4657\">Swiney</a>, who could manipulate the art market in British circles? Regretfully, if Carriera penned responses to these letters, they are lost to us, so we can only speculate about what her thoughts might have been. Nevertheless, it is clear that the artist gained important information from women such as Broughton and Read. Ultimately, as Carriera’s correspondence reveals, her business could both benefit and suffer from the close connections and maneuverings in the circles of British travelers to Italy.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"into-the-studio\">Into the Studio</h1>\n\n<p>What might the Explorer tell us about Carriera’s studio? The richest source of information on the physical layout and contents of the studio is the inventory of Carriera’s belongings after her death.<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> We know that when visitors entered the gallery area of the artist’s studio, they would have stepped into a large, comfortable, vibrant space decorated with green wallpaper and gilt-framed mirrors. The room was populated by numerous chairs upholstered in green damask, small Chinoiserie tables, and a small clock with a pedestal. At the ready were sets of porcelain cups and saucers for hot chocolate and coffee. In winter, visitors could warm themselves by the fireplace as they studied the paintings on display: the inventory notes twenty pastels and seven oil paintings in the gallery in addition to numerous other works of art in the central corridor (fig. 15).<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-15\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../sama-figure-15.jpg\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap15&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap15\">\n\nFig. 15. An excerpt from the inventory that was made of Rosalba Carriera&rsquo;s studio following her death. This document is a rich source of information about the physical layout of Carriera&rsquo;s studio, but the Grand Tour Explorer complements this by enabling researchers to quickly bring together several accounts of those who sat for portraits in her studio, offering a traveler&rsquo;s perspective on her process. Inquisitori alle acque, b. 79, no. 80 [carta con &ldquo;Nella Galleria&rdquo;], Archivio di Stato di Venezia.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>I hoped the Explorer could help me learn more about the process of sitting for a portrait in Carriera’s studio, as well as the studio’s role as a social space. I was, therefore, looking for firsthand descriptions by Grand Tourists of their visits to the studio, something I could do efficiently because the database includes excerpts from travelers’ letters and journals. I created search term combinations such as <em>Carriera</em>/<em>Rosalba</em>, combined with words and phrases such as <em>studio</em>, <em>sat to</em>, <em>sitting</em>, <em>miniature</em>, <em>pastel</em>, <em>portrait</em>, <em>likeness</em>, <em>draw</em>, <em>paint</em>, <em>chalk</em>, <em>studio</em>, <em>mask</em>, and so forth. These searches resulted in, among others, three entries: <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4366\">George Sinclair</a> (after 1714–76, travel years 1737–38), <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1760\">Martin Folkes</a> (1690–1754, travel years 1733–35), and <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/368\">Willem (or William) Bentinck</a> (1704–74, travel years 1727–28). The Explorer search results prodded me to consider these three entries together as a group. Consequently, we are granted a more vibrant and nuanced picture of life inside Carriera’s studio from the traveler’s vantage point.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors frequently remarked that Carriera had portraits of their compatriots on display in her studio. When <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4366\">George Sinclair</a> visited the artist in the spring of 1738, he noted in his travel journal (as recorded in the <em>Dictionary</em> and hence the Explorer) that he “saw many of her Portraits, both men and women, several english [<em>sic</em>] among them.” Keeping these likenesses about the studio was surely Carriera’s strategy not only to exhibit her talent but also to induce visitors to have their own portraits made by the famous artist’s hand. In this way, she promoted the notion that possession of her artworks was a benchmark of social success.</p>\n\n<p>The display of such portraits also served a social function in the life of the studio. <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1760\">Martin Folkes</a>—scientist, antiquary, and protégé of Isaac Newton—visited Carriera in the summer of 1733 as part of his travels in Italy. He wrote in his journal on July 14 that the artist’s “pictures in crayon have been with Justice esteem[e]d the most excellent pieces of art of that sort.”<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> He described the artist as “now better than 50” (she was sixty years old) and declared that during his visit to the studio, he was “extremely well entertained with a great number of fine portraits some of my acquaintance very like.” Folkes also mentioned seeing an Allegory of Music in the studio, which he declared to be “as fine and well disposed as almost anyth[ing] I have seen.” He believed the model for the painting was the lover of an Englishman.<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Whether or not visitors commissioned a work by Carriera, then, it could please and amuse them to find their acquaintances visually present in the studio along with them. By functioning as “virtual” companions and as conversation pieces, the portraits enhanced the level of sociability in Carriera’s studio by encouraging sitters and guests to feel at ease and engaged. Although the excerpt is not included in the Explorer entry, <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/1760\">Folkes</a>’s journal supplies us with further information about social life in the studio. Folkes noted that all three Carriera sisters—Rosalba, Giovanna, and Angela— were present during his visit. He remarked that the latter expressed “a great regard” for England, since she had sojourned there with her husband, the artist Antonio Pellegrini.<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup> Not only did Angela and, especially, Giovanna work in the studio; they also engaged in professional networking by participating in social gatherings with visitors and potential clients.</p>\n\n<p>The Explorer entry on Anglo-Dutch traveler and statesman <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/368\">Willem (or William) Bentinck (van Rhoon)</a> is especially rich regarding Carriera’s studio.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> Excerpts from Bentinck’s and from his tutor’s letters to family in England offer what may be the most detailed account that we have of a client sitting for Carriera. In 1727, as part of a two-year tour of Europe, the Grand Tourist and his tutor <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/389\">Moses Bernège</a> (travel years 1717–28, 1730–31) spent three weeks in Venice. Just prior to their arrival in Venice, they had seen and admired Carriera’s portraits of King Augustus in Dresden. Bentinck sat for Carriera, intending the portrait to be a gift for his mother, the Dowager Countess of Portland. Bernège’s letter to the countess discloses that when Bentinck arrived for the fifth and final sitting, “Rosalba chastised him roundly” for having cut his hair.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> In Bernège’s account, the artist was so frustrated at the change in her client’s appearance from his previous sittings that she demanded that he complete the portrait himself by drawing in his hair the way it was before he had cut it. This image of an impatient Carriera is echoed in her correspondence, where she occasionally bemoans the fact that she must spend time making portraits of so many <em>inglesi</em> that she cannot get to her other commissions, even for important, royal patrons.</p>\n\n<p>The Explorer search results prompted me to take a closer look at the <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/389\">Bernège</a>/<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/368\">Bentinck</a> papers directly.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> Many of Carriera’s European contacts and clients populate these letters—from couriers and middlemen to clergy, royalty, and artists. Details in the manuscripts that are not included in the database allowed me to add further dimension to our view into Carriera’s studio. In contrast to his tutor’s version of events, Bentinck’s is far more peaceable, implying that it had been a collaborative and even thoughtful idea for him to draw in his own hair, specifically in order to ensure that his mother not be startled by any change in his appearance (fig. 16). He relates the experience: “But as you remember me with my hair, which was cut off before the Picture was made, that must have made some alteration in the Physio[g]nomy. Yet to prevent that as much as possible and to hide the cutting of my hair, which I did not think you knew, Rosalba gave me her colours, and all the hair upon the forehead, and close to the face are of my own painting, as much as I could remember my hair had been.”<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup> Frequently eager to please and assuage his mother in his letters, Bentinck is keen to assure her that the portrait was indeed a good likeness, as “it was thought like by those that saw it at Venice, before I sent it.”<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> In fact, son and tutor consistently offer conflicting views of the visit. While Bentinck assures his mother that his portrait “will always be worth something,” his tutor notes that there were portraits hanging in Carriera’s studio that were “strong likenesses” and that Bentinck’s, while good, would have been better had he not cut his hair. Bernège also implies that his ward may have squandered his opportunity for acquiring a fine portrait by Carriera, commenting tersely that “she will stop working very soon as she is starting to become quite aged.”<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup> Although Bernège’s concern over the quality of the portrait was understandable, his prediction regarding Carriera was inaccurate, as she would go on to work for more than two decades.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-16\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../sama-figure-16.png\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap16&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap16\">\n\nFig. 16. Grand Tourist William Bentinck's letter to his mother, dated September 13, 1727, offers us one of the most detailed extant accounts of what it was like to sit for Carriera in her studio. &copy; British Library Board, MS Egerton 1711/ff.531r.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/368\">Bentinck</a>/<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/389\">Bernège</a> papers also highlight the dangers inherent in shipping works of art and other memorabilia acquired on the Grand Tour—namely, damage and theft. Bentinck’s instructions to the Dowager Countess reflect the attention Carriera gave to protecting her works from damage in transit, a theme that appears frequently in her correspondence. He tells his mother that the portrait will arrive “in a little black frame with a glass over it and must be left so, she [Carriera] herself desired me that it might be left just as it is because taking it out might easily spoil the Picture, and nothing moist must come near it.”<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup> In a subsequent letter, Bernège expresses relief in the knowledge that Carriera’s portrait arrived safely in England “because there was reason to fear that the ship had been commandeered by pirates and taken to Spain. The loss of the portrait would have deeply saddened us.”<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/368\">Bentinck</a>/<a href=\"https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/389\">Bernège</a> correspondence is also of interest because it challenges the oft-quoted notion that the creation of pastel portraits was a quick affair, especially when compared to portraits in oil, which required extensive time to dry. Bernège reported that “Madame Rosalba took great care to do it, and requested several visits of Monsieur Bentinck so she could be as successful as possible.”<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup> Perhaps pastel portraits did take longer than is usually assumed if Carriera typically had her clients sit for her several times for one portrait.</p>\n\n<p>As we have seen in the case with Rosalba Carriera, navigating the Explorer in combination with primary sources is an effective and engaging way to build a nuanced map of the connections between British Grand Tourists and their Italian contemporaries. In diverse ways, the Explorer exemplifies the best of digital humanities resources. Its accessibility online makes it a resource not only for scholars but for any interested reader, regardless of one’s knowledge about the world of the Grand Tour. Scholars interacting with the database can design and employ diverse combinations of searches and filters for efficient and precise targeting of information. Finally, one of the Explorer’s most important features is the way that its search power puts seemingly unrelated pieces of information into dialogue with one another, leading to new perspectives, questions, and ideas.</p>\n\n<div class=\"dataButton\" onclick=\"window.open('https://purl.stanford.edu/yb732rj4564','mywindow');\">Download and explore the data behind this essay</div>\n\n<h1 id=\"notes\">Notes</h1>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>On the Dresden gallery, see Stephan Koja and Roland Enke, eds., <em>Rosalba Carriera: Perfection in Pastel</em> (Sandstein Verlag, 2023); Andreas Henning and Harald Marx, <em>Das Kabinette der Rosalba: Carriera und die Pastelle der Dresdner Gemäldegalerie alte Meister</em> (Munich and Berlin: Deutscher Kunstverlag, 2007); and Andreas Henning, “Rosalba Carriera e la collezione dei suoi pastelli a Dresda,” in Giuseppe Pavanello, ed., <em>Rosalba Carriera (1673-1757): Atti del convegno internazionale di studi, 26–28 aprile 2007, Venezia, Fondazione Giorgio Cini, Chioggia, Auditorium San Niccolò</em> (Valencia: Scripta, 2009), 273-360. <a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>For essential works on Carriera, see Bernardina Sani’s edited volumes of the artist’s correspondence and diary, as well as her catalogs of Carriera’s works: <em>Rosalba Carriera: Lettere, diari, frammenti</em> (Firenze: Olschki, 1985); and <em>Rosalba Carriera (1673–1757): Maestra del pastello nell’Europa ancien régime</em> (1988; Torino: Umberto Allemandi, 2007).

Examples of Digital Humanities Projects and Introduction to the Grand Tour Explorer</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-1-introduction-30-min\">Part 1. Introduction (30 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p>Discussion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What do we know about the digital humanities?</li>\n<li>What do we think the definition of digital humanities is? The purpose? What projects have we encountered, either at this university or elsewhere?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Digital humanities (broadly speaking) describes the application of digital technologies to exploring traditional humanities questions. Digital history emphasizes the use of digital methodologies in collecting, navigating, annotating, presenting, and analyzing primary and secondary historical sources and arguments.</p>\n\n<p>Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Data Collection and Navigation: WorldCat (https://worldcat.org), GoogleBooks (https://books.google.com/), VIAF (Virtual International Authority File, https://viaf.org), World Historical Gazetteer(https://whgazetteer.org/)</li>\n<li>Presentation and Annotation: Pelagios (https://pelagios.org/), Medici Archive Project (MAP, https://www.medici.org/), Enslaved: Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade (https://enslaved.org), Smithsonian Digital Volunteers (https://transcription.si.edu)</li>\n<li>Presentation and Analysis: Orbis (https://orbis.stanford.edu/), Martha Ballard’s Diary (https://dohistory.org/diary/), Stanford Literary Lab Pamphlets (https://litlab.stanford.edu/pamphlets/)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note: Each of these approaches might correspond to a different stage of the research process or desired output and audience.</p>\n\n<p>Often, historical data is collected and presented in several general forms.</p>\n\n<p>Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Textual Data: Early Modern Letters Online (http://emlo-portal.bodleian.ox.ac.uk)</li>\n<li>Spatial Data: DECIMA (https://decima-map.net/)</li>\n<li>Network Data: Six Degrees of Francis Bacon (http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/)</li>\n<li>Mixed Media: Hidden Cities App (https://hiddencities.eu/)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>These different presentations of data rely on different underlying structures, as well as platforms. The end goal of a project guides the initial collection and categorization of data. Digital tools can be used to explore data but still rely on a foundation of a “historical research question,” such as what were the effects of X on Y over time?</p>\n\n<p>Activity:</p>\n\n<p>Take a couple of minutes to explore one of the linked projects. Working in pairs, formulate what you think the foundational historical question might have been. Can you find it somewhere in the project itself? How has it been presented or highlighted visually or textually?</p>\n\n<p>Discussion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><i>Invite a subset of students to share the results of the activity.</i></li>\n<li>What does it mean to consider historical information as data? What is gained or lost as a result?</li>\n<li>What other kinds of data might be mined from historical sources?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-2-the-grand-tour-explorer-20-min\">Part 2. The Grand Tour Explorer (20 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p>The Grand Tour Explorer represents the secondary source <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy, 1701-1800</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Ford archive by John Ingamells (henceforward the <em>Dictionary</em>), which was published in 1997 based on the primary source material gathered from a variety of archives.</p>\n\n<p>Activity:</p>\n\n<p>Pass around a physical copy or direct students to pages from the <em>Dictionary</em> (https://books.google.com/books?id=7Z0_EAAAQBAJ), giving students a minute or two to read.</p>\n\n<p>Discussion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What is the difference between a primary and secondary source?</li>\n<li>What are the advantages of a physical reference material?</li>\n<li>How do you think a digital tool might translate or improve the experience of a reference material?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The foundational object of the Grand Tour Explorer is the entry, which sometimes (but not always!) represents an individual traveler. Within that we have subobjects shown on an individual entry page, including biographical details (left) and tours (right) (fig. 1).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-1.png\" id=\"fig1\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap1\">\nFig. 1.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The Grand Tour Explorer parses the data found in the dictionary into these different categories, represented by different sections of the entry page:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The biography</li>\n<li>The narrative</li>\n<li>The tours</li>\n<li>The notes</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The process of parsing has been done for us by the Explorer, as has some presentation. Any analysis is up to us!</p>\n\n<p>Discussion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What kinds of questions can you imagine based on this data?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sample of statements from historians about the Grand Tour:</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>&ldquo;There was no cult of the countryside: tourists travelled as rapidly as possible between major cities, and regarded mountains with horror, not joy&rdquo; (Jeremy Black, <i>Italy and the Grand Tour</i>, 3).</li>\n<li>&ldquo;While major Italian urban centres continued to be appreciated mostly as repositories of past glories, as early as 1700 Turin was perceived by many foreign observers as an exception on the Italian peninsula &ndash; a place of great social relevance by virtue of its political and cultural modernity&rdquo; (Paola Bianchi, &ldquo;The British at the Turin Royal Academy: Cosmopolitanism and Religious Pragmatism,&rdquo; in Paola Bianchi and Karin Wolfe, eds., <i>Turin and the British in the Age of the Grand Tour</i>, 91).</li>\n<li>&ldquo;The length of time spent in &lsquo;making the tour&rsquo; fell over the course of the century, but even in the early nineteenth century many tours lasted six months at the very least, and the costs could be prohibitive&rdquo; (Rosemary Sweet, <i>Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c. 1690&ndash;1820</i>, 2).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Discussion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> One of the best starting points with DH is hypothesis testing. How would you start to explore some of these statements using the Explorer interface?\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;\">\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em\">Example of free-search for &ldquo;mountains,&rdquo; &ldquo;countryside,&rdquo; &ldquo;money&rdquo;, &ldquo;price&rdquo; (fig. 2).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-2\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-2.png\" id=\"fig2\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap2&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap2\">\nFig. 2.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em\">Free-search for &ldquo;modern&rdquo; in combination with place search &ldquo;Turin&rdquo; (fig. 3).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-3.png\" id=\"fig3\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap3\">\nFig. 3.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em\">Range of years search for &ldquo;1700&rdquo; to &ldquo;1750&rdquo; (fig. 4).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-4.png\" id=\"fig4\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap4&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap4\">\nFig. 4.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>What might these searches be capturing or missing? </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Writing history is often a matter of balancing the complexity of reality with “selecting representative examples.” Searching in this manner turns up a number of individuals who could be used as cases to help prove an overall argument; however, we might have trouble evaluating how correct that argument is.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-3-using-the-explorer-30-min\">Part 3. Using the Explorer (30 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p>The last example also represents the difficulty of representing “change over time,” which is a crucial component of a sophisticated historical argument. Just like we break reality into selected examples (often called “case studies”), we can also break time into select chunks (often called “timeslices”).</p>\n\n<p>Activity:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li> Come up with a method you would use to measure the number of a type of traveler over a period of time. You may select timeslices (using a before, during, and after approach), or you may use regular units (such as decades). You can also limit your search to travelers with a certain attribute (such as women, painters, military men) or a certain place. Aim for at least three numbers, and fill out a table in the format of table 1.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Time</th>\n      <th>Number of Entries</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>DATE-DATE</td>\n      <td>#</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>DATE-DATE</td>\n      <td>#</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>DATE-DATE</td>\n      <td>#</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n <figcaption style=\"text-align:center\">Table 1.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Discussion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><i>Invite a subset of students to share the results of the activity.</i></li>\n<li>What choices did you make and why?</li>\n<li>How did the Explorer guide, aid, or hinder your desires?</li>\n<li>How would you write or state your research question? What would be a preliminary answer?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Assignment:</p>\n\n<p>Establish a hypothesis regarding the experience of the Grand Tour based on your reading for the second session—for example, “travelers went to Rome for religious reasons,” or “women did not stay in Naples.” List five search terms that might help you find supporting evidence for an argument. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of different types of searches. Write a short response (five hundred words) describing your findings among the entries and whether you think they ultimately support or disprove your hypothesis.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"practicum-2-data--quantitative-methods-sort-filter-reformatting-formulas-pivot-in-google-sheets\">Practicum 2. Data &amp; Quantitative Methods: Sort, Filter, Reformatting, Formulas, Pivot in Google Sheets</h1>\n\n<p>Reading:</p>\n\n<p>Selections from Lady Anna Riggs Miller’s <em>Letters from Italy</em> (1776), 174–95. [https://wellcomecollection.org/works/yk4f9tms]</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-1-introduction-15-min\">Part 1. Introduction (15 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p><em>Note: Remind all students to practice accessing Google Sheets prior to class meeting. And another important reminder: Google Sheets is an application that is updated and changed often, including with the addition of new features. Most of what is presented here is based on the 2024 version except some features that are different and/or augmented. Use what follows as a baseline, keeping in mind that how things work for students might differ from Mac to PC.</em></p>\n\n<p>Review:</p>\n\n<p>Last week, we discussed the meaning of digital humanities, types of digital history projects, and their uses. We began using the Grand Tour Explorer to explore the biographical dictionary of British travelers. We tested hypotheses provided by historical secondary sources by running some basic searches.</p>\n\n<p>Discussion:</p>\n\n<p>Discuss last session’s assignment in small groups.</p>\n\n<p>While case studies and timeslices allow us two methods of making a complex reality approachable, they require conscious choices on the part of the historian. That choice can be educated by primary and secondary sources, or it can be earned in years of gaining a professional “sense.” By exporting large amounts of data from the Explorer, we can read many entries at a distance, allowing us to explore the overall shape of the data before moving to the next step of historical work.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we can adapt the data to better answer our questions, essentially increasing or decreasing the detail (frequently called “granularity”) that we wish to capture. See, for example, statements about positive and negative impressions from the reading:</p>\n\n<p>“Tourist complaints about the major routes in northern Italy, those from Turin to both Genoa and Parma, and from Milan via Parma to Bologna, were limited. Indeed, the road system was best in Piedmont and Lombardy, both territories with reasonably effective government. The Venetian system was not regarded in as favorable a light” (Jeremy Black, <i>Italy and the Grand Tour</i>, 83).</p>\n\n<p>We could imagine adding a “negative” or “positive” sentiment value for individual locations based on reading entries, thereby grouping entries into broader categories (as sentiment analysis seeks to do!). Additionally, we can add new “quantitative attributes” by performing basic calculations using the provided data.</p>\n\n<p>(Intro and specify that readings will include Anne Miller)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-2-sorting-reformatting-and-filtering-in-sheets-30-min\">Part 2. Sorting, Reformatting, and Filtering in Sheets (30 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p>Most digital humanities data will be in a “TSV” (tab-separated value) or “CSV” (comma-separated value) format. This format is easily translated between Excel, Google Sheets, Google OpenRefine, and many other programs.</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>Begin by running a search in the Explorer for travelers with &ldquo;Travel date&rdquo; in the range of years from 1770 to 1775 (around the same time as Lady Anne Riggs Miller) (fig. 5).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-5.png\" id=\"fig5\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap5&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap5\">\nFig. 5.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n<li>At the top right of the screen, select &ldquo;Export Results&rdquo; (fig. 6). Move the resulting zip file somewhere that you will be able to find it easily.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-6\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-6.png\" id=\"fig6\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap6&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap6\">\nFig. 6.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n<li>Open a new file in Google Sheets. We will use this data to learn our way around Sheets.</li>\n\n<li>We can have multiple sheets within a single file. Click on the &ldquo;+&rdquo; icon at the bottom left of the page. Create two new sheets, and name the sheets &ldquo;Travelers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Itineraries,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life Events.&rdquo; Opening the exported files in a basic text editor (such as TextEdit or Notepad), select all the contents and copy and paste them into the corresponding sheets (fig. 7). <i>Note: You can also import the data directly by going to File&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Import&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Upload. It will be necessary to set the separator type to &ldquo;Tab&rdquo; as the files are in TSV format.</i>\n\n<figure>\n<a name=\"figure-7\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-7.png\" id=\"fig7\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap7\">\nFig. 7.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Because we already limited our search in the Explorer to travelers between 1770 and 1775, we will only have data for entries which have records for one or more “tours” that fall within that date range. The “Travelers” and “Life_Events” sheets will provide data for only those travelers.</p>\n\n<p>Each of the sheets corresponds to one another by means of a “unique identifier,” in our case the “Entry ID”. A visualization program is able to quickly match data across the tables as long as the unique identifiers are written exactly the same across sheets. This means no variation in spacing, capitalization, or punctuation.</p>\n\n<p>Discussion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why use identifiers rather than full names?</li>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;\">\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em\">Consider sharing Patrick McKenzie, &ldquo;Falsehoods Programmers Believe about Names&rdquo; (https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/)</li></ul>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>We will now explore our data and practice the following operations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Sorting data</li>\n<li>Reformatting data</li>\n<li>Filtering data</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The data in the “Travelers” sheet begins in “ascending” order based on the “Entry ID,” which roughly follows the organization of the book by “alphabetical order.” Let’s instead resort the data by birthDate. This means that travelers with the earliest birth date will be located at the beginning of the sheet.</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>First we want to make sure to keep our first row with the column names where it is (our header row). We can do this by opening the &ldquo;View&rdquo; column and selecting &ldquo;View&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Freeze&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1 row&rdquo; (fig. 8).&rdquo;\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-8\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-8.png\" id=\"fig8\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap8&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap8\">\nFig. 8.\n</figcaption>\n</figure> \n\nNow when we resort the data the header will remain where it is.</li>\n\n<li>Select the birth date column by clicking on the corresponding letter at the top of the sheet (it should be column D).</li>\n\n<li>Open the &ldquo;Data&rdquo; menu at the top of the page. We have several options here:\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;\">\n\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em\">&ldquo;Sort sheet&rdquo; will sort the entire sheet using the selected column. &ldquo;Sort range&rdquo; will just reorder the selected column.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;\">A-&gt;Z and vice versa offers us the ability to sort in &ldquo;ascending&rdquo; (A-&gt;Z) or descending (Z-&gt;A) order. This will also work with numerical data, as we have in the birth date column (fig. 9).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-9\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-9.png\" id=\"fig9\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap9&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap9\">\nFig. 9.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n</ol></li>\n<li>Try each combination of options (using Edit&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Undo or Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;Z or Cmd&nbsp;+&nbsp;Z after each sort). Which is the one we want to more easily view our travelers from &ldquo;youngest at 1720 to oldest&rdquo;? <i>Note: Be careful about accidentally using the range option when you mean to use sheet; this will break the logical connections established between entries and their &ldquo;attribute&rdquo; data&mdash;that is, the first and following columns.</i></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let’s navigate to the “Itineraries” sheet. The coordinates are provided in the format of “Latitude, Longitude” because this is the format that best works with the “Palladio visualization platform.” Other visualization platforms (Gephi, Tableau) will require, however, that we have longitude and latitude in separate columns. We can separate this column now.</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>Begin by duplicating our &ldquo;coordinates&rdquo; column. We can do so by right-clicking the column, selecting &ldquo;Insert 1 column right (fig. 10).&rdquo;\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-10\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-10.png\" id=\"fig10\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap10&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap10\">\nFig. 10.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe then select the coordinates column by clicking on the column name row and copy and paste the data into the new, blank column. We could just perform our operations directly on the coordinates column; however, it is generally a good idea to add new columns and preserve each stage of data manipulation. After all, we might be moving between platforms that require different formats or need to briefly revert without undoing other changes. We can name this new column dupCoordinates (fig. 11).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-11\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-11.png\" id=\"fig11\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap11&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap11\">\nFig. 11.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n<li>Let&rsquo;s move our &ldquo;dupCoordinates&rdquo; column to the end of our sheet. When we split the data, we want to make sure we don&rsquo;t accidentally overwrite any other data. You can move a column by clicking on the letter at the top of its first row, then when the hand icon appears, by clicking and dragging to the desired location.</li>\n\n<li>Keep the dupCoordinates column selected, and open the Data menu. Select &ldquo;Data&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Split text to columns&rdquo; (fig. 12).\n \n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-12\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-12.png\" id=\"fig12\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap12&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap12\">\nFig. 12.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIn general, Sheets will guess what character indicates where you would like to separate the data in the &ldquo;Separator&rdquo; window that opens near the bottom of the screen. It will remove the separator and distribute your data to a number of columns equal to the number of instances of the separator character. If you would like to be sure, you can click on the &ldquo;Detect automatically&rdquo; and replace it with the &ldquo;Comma&rdquo; option.</li>\n\n<li>Now we can rename the newly split columns as &ldquo;latitude&rdquo; and &ldquo;longitude&rdquo; (fig. 13).\n \n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-13\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-13.png\" id=\"fig13\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap13&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap13\">\nFig. 13.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let’s move to the “Life Events” sheet. Perhaps we want to quickly view only those travelers for whom there is some marriage data. We could sort the “lifeEvents” column alphabetically using our previous method, but it is also possible to filter the data.</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>Select the lifeEvents column by clicking on the column letter above its first row and then navigate to &ldquo;Data&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Create a Filter&rdquo; (fig. 14).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-14\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-14.png\" id=\"fig14\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap14&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap14\">\nFig. 14.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n<li>Next to lifeEvents, you should now see a green arrowhead pointing down (fig. 15). \n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-15\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-15.png\" id=\"fig15\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap15&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap15\">\nFig. 15.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n<li>Click on this to open the &ldquo;Filter&rdquo; menu. The filter menu consists of several options. We can sort here, but doing so will sort the range rather than the sheet. We are interested instead in &ldquo;Filter by condition&rdquo; and &ldquo;Filter by values.&rdquo;</li>\n\n<li>The default is for all values to be shown.

Formulas, Operations and Pivot Tables (30 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve now experimented with sorting, reformatting, and filtering data. Let’s now try applying these skills to a more complex problem and experiment with using “formulas.” What if instead we wanted to figure out the “age” of a traveler at “time of travel”? Which pieces of information in the sheets can we use to determine this?</p>\n\n<p>We can break our more complex question into the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>Filter for travelers with both a known birthDate and startYear.</li>\n<li>Relocate the birthDate data and startYear columns to the same sheet.</li>\n<li>Subtract the birthDate data from the startYear for each trip to find the age at the start of travel.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>We have two pieces of data that we need to put in conversation: the “birthDate” column in the “Travelers” sheet, and the travel dates (represented as startYear and endYear). Let’s use startYear to determine the age of travelers when they began their trips.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll need to make a copy of the birthDate information on the “Itineraries” sheet. We can do this by using the “VLOOKUP()” formula.</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>On the Itineraries sheet, create a new column titled &ldquo;birthYear.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Click on the first empty cell in the column and write &ldquo;=VLOOKUP.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Once we&rsquo;ve begun a formula, sheets will provide a drop-down to display more information (fig. 27). In figure 27, we can see that the correct format is &ldquo;VLOOKUP(search_key, range, index, [is_sorted]).</li>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-27\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-27.png\" id=\"fig27\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap27&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap27\">\nFig. 27.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe last value is in brackets, meaning it is optional, but the remainder values are mandatory.\n\nIn this case, we want the following:\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;\">\n\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em\">Search_key: The Entry ID column of the &ldquo;Itineraries&rdquo; sheet.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;\">Range: The whole of the &ldquo;Travelers&rdquo; sheet.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;\">Index: The column index (meaning the distance from the leftmost column as column 1) of the desired value, so in this case, the number corresponding to the birthDate column of the &ldquo;Travelers&rdquo; sheet.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;\">Is_Sorted: FALSE will return an exact match, while TRUE will return an approximate match.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;\">Any cell in a sheet has a &ldquo;reference value&rdquo; marked by its column (represented by the letter at the top of the sheet) and its row (represented by the number at the side of the sheet). We use these reference values to fill out the formula.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;\">For the &ldquo;search_key,&rdquo; we want to indicate the whole of the Entry ID column, except for the header. We can indicate this with &ldquo;A:A,&rdquo; which indicates the whole column. Once we have entered this into the formula, we also see sheets color the corresponding values that have been selected. Alternatively, if we are ever unsure how to indicate our desired values, we can click and drag to select them on the sheet, and see the formula autopopulate with the corresponding value.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;\">Next we want to enter the &ldquo;range &ldquo;for the formula, which is located on the other sheet. In order to indicate a different sheet, we can either navigate to that sheet and select the data with our cursor, or enter the following: &ldquo;Travelers!A:M.&rdquo; This indicates that we want to search the entirety of the &ldquo;Entries&rdquo; sheet (columns A through M). The VLOOKUP function automatically searches the first column.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;\">Next we want to enter the &ldquo;index.&rdquo; In this case, we want the birthDate column of the Entries sheet, which is located in the fourth column. We put a &ldquo;4.&rdquo;</li>\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;\">Finally, we want to make sure we are only getting an exact match, so we will type FALSE.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;\">In sum, our formula should read &ldquo; =VLOOKUP(A2:A,Entries!A:Z,4,FALSE)&rdquo; (fig. 28).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-28\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-28.png\" id=\"fig28\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap28&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap28\">\nFig. 28.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n</ol>\n\n<li>We hit enter and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. get a blank cell! (fig. 29). What happened? If we look at the &ldquo;Travelers&rdquo; sheet, we see that the first entry, &ldquo;Aberdeen,&rdquo; does not have an associated birthDate.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-29\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-29.png\" id=\"fig29\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap29&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap29\">\nFig. 29.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIn this case, the formula returns a blank cell, which is correct. We can fill down with a formula the same way as we did with a single value. Select the cell with your formula, hold SHIFT, select the final cell and hit CTRL&nbsp;+&nbsp;D or CMD&nbsp;+&nbsp;D.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>We have successfully duplicated the birthYear information onto the “Itineraries” sheet.

How could we use filters to remove this data or, better yet, create a filter view for only travelers with known birth dates?</p>\n\n<p>We have successfully found the age of travelers during their trips! In the next session, we’ll explore how to do some basic visualization of this information, but using formulas in sheets, we can also figure out the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The median age of travelers between 1770 and 1775</li>\n<li>The minimum age (the youngest traveler)</li>\n<li>The maximum age (the oldest traveler)</li>\n<li>The ages of Anne Miller during her travels</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>What if, instead, we wanted to know how representative Anne Miller was and where travelers her age generally went? In this case, we might use a “pivot table,” which you’ll get more of a chance to explore in the assignment for this session.</p>\n\n<p>A pivot table <em>summarizes</em> our data.

For the purpose of this exercise, assume that the summer lasts from June through September, and include travels that started or ended in those months.

Networks and Graphs in Palladio</h1>\n\n<p>Reading:</p>\n\n<p>Hester Lynch Piozzi, <em>Observations and Reflections Made in the Course of a Journey through France, Italy, and Germany</em> (1789): 187–215.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-1-introduction-10-min\">Part 1. Introduction (10 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p>Review:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>In the last session, we practiced downloading, viewing, and manipulating data in Google Sheets. The assignment reinforced how many tasks can be performed outside and inside of the Explorer.</li>\n<li>What observations did you make about the role of seasonality and age in travel?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Explorer can give us information about individual travelers; however, it can also suggest important <em>connections</em> between travelers.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if we look up Hester Piozzi, we see that her travels are shown in the column on the right, beneath the minimap. We see that she began her travels in Turin in October of 1784. If we click on that trip, we are taken to a screen where we can see every other traveler present in Turin on that date (fig. 36).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-36\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-36.png\" id=\"fig36\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap36&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap36\">\nFig. 36.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>In a way, “copresence” establishes a kind of relationship between the travelers.</p>\n\n<p>Often, the best way to represent relationships in data is a network model. A network model generally consists of “nodes” (often represented by shape objects) and “edges” (often represented by lines between shapes). We can represent the circle of British travelers in Turin that October in two forms:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A bimodal network connects two varieties of things and therefore includes more than one type of node: so, a central node of &ldquo;Turin&rdquo; is connected by edges to many other nodes representing individual travelers.</li>\n<li>A unimodal network connects the same varieties of things and therefore includes only one node type: so, presence in Turin in October becomes the edge that connects the travelers to each other.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The two models represent the same data, just in two different ways: in the first, Turin is represented as a node; in the second, it has been “collapsed” into the edges.</p>\n\n<p>But is it safe to presume that the travelers in Turin did, in fact, have some kind of relationship to one another? We are using copresence as a proxy for other types of relationships—social, conversational, transactional—but we need to critically consider the accuracy of a chosen proxy.</p>\n\n<p>If we search within this copresent group of travelers in Turin in October 1784 by Mentioned names: “Piozzi,” the only other match is presumably a family member—meaning the other entries do not specifically support that the individual met and interacted with Hester Piozzi, at least as recorded by the assemblers of Ingamells’ biographical dictionary.</p>\n\n<p>So far we have taken all of our data from the Explorer; however, the Explorer can also be put into dialogue with other sources. This week we will explore how to interpret a primary source into a “data table” and its use for building “network models.”</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-2-hester-piozzis-imagined-network-40-min\">Part 2. Hester Piozzi’s Imagined Network (40 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p>When Hester Piozzi traveled, she did so with a wide network—not just other Brits and Italians but a series of literary, historical, and imagined companions. One of the great virtues of networks is that they allow us to include many different types of information in one data table—in this case, friends, real and imagined.</p>\n\n<p>Activity:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>In small groups, take the next ten minutes to highlight every reference to a person&rsquo;s name that you find in the week&rsquo;s reading and add a small annotation regarding the relationship Piozzi has with them.</li>\n<li>Is she citing them, referring to them, or acquainted with them?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Discussion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Was it always clear when a person was being referenced? Why or why not?</li>\n<li>What categories did you decide to use for types of people or relationships, and why?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>A network model generally requires two types of tables, an “edge table” and a “node table.”</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Each row in a node table represents a distinct entity that we will represent as a node; in this case, each person&rsquo;s name and one or more attributes consistently associated with them.</li>\n<li>Each row in an edge table represents an instance of a relationship and the individual with whom that relationship takes place. This can take the form of a directed or undirected relationship, such as the directed relationship of a buyer and seller or the undirected relationship of friendship.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Take a few minutes now to begin a new spreadsheet, adding your information into row and edge tables (represented here as different “sheets” within the document). Use the following formats:</p>\n\n<p>Node Table:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>name</th>\n      <th>attribute</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><i>E.g. Hester Piozzi</i></td>\n      <td><i>author</i></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Edge Table:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>source</th>\n      <th>target</th>\n      <th>relationship</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><i>E.g. Hester Piozzi</i></td>\n      <td><i> Lady Cowper </i></td>\n      <td><i> friends</i></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>In creating Hester Piozzi’s imagined network, we are creating what is known as an “ego network,” meaning a network more or less revolving around a single individual. We can see that in the edge table, we may often put Hester Piozzi as the source or target of a relationship. <em>Note: Which node should be the “source” or the “target” of a relationship is an interpretive choice. It will not make much difference for a simple Palladio visualization but will have more analytical weight when performing more complex network operations. Just consider this practice for now!</em></p>\n\n<p>We can add as many attributes as we might like to the nodes and edges. When choosing your categories, you will frequently need to balance the need for specificity with generality, for accuracy with ambiguity. To be meaningful, our categories will generally need to encompass multiple nodes or edges.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, you might want to include multiple pieces of information in a cell; we can do so, but we will need to designate each piece as such by using a standardized separator, such as a semicolon.</p>\n\n<p>The more categories we build into our data construction, the more “variables” we can adjust in our visualizations and the more complexity we can add to our explorations. Let’s add an additional “gender” column to our nodes table and fill it to the best of our ability.</p>\n\n<p>Where can we infer gender? Where does it become more difficult?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-3-visualizing-piozzis-network-30-min\">Part 3. Visualizing Piozzi’s Network (30 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p>Once we have finished entering information for Piozzi’s network, we can experiment with visualizing the results in Palladio (https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/), a Stanford-created platform for the visualization of historical data.</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>Navigate to Palladio&rsquo;s main landing page (fig. 37), and choose to start a new project.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-37a\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-37.png\" id=\"fig37\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap37&apos;))\" /> </a>    \n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap37\">\nFig. 37.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n<li>Let&rsquo;s begin by copying and pasting our data from our edge table into the box and clicking &ldquo;load.&rdquo; Palladio will parse the different columns of data automatically. <i>Note: Try not to include empty rows or columns when inputting your data into Palladio.</i></li>\n<li>We can provide a title for the project and a name for the table.

We can simply choose it from the dropdown menu to the right of &ldquo;Extension.&rdquo;</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Do we see any red or yellow arrows? This means the data has not been able to correctly match. If we take a look, we will likely find that there is some slight difference in the way that a name has been input into one table versus the other. Palladio will interpret any variation in spelling, punctuation, or capitalization as a different value. To correct the data, we will have to change it in the original sheet and reload it into Palladio.</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>We should see a red dot next to the relationship category in the Edge table. Let&rsquo;s click there now.</li>\n<li>The window that opens gives us several options of data to alter, including the column name, the data type, and&mdash;to the right&mdash;special characters. In this case, Palladio may correctly guess that we have multiple values in single cells. To correctly separate these values (i.e., to have Sir William Hamilton count for both &ldquo;expert&rdquo; and &ldquo;author&rdquo;), we can put the semicolon in the &ldquo;Multiple values&rdquo; field.

Introduction (10 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p>Review:</p>\n\n<p>We have now practiced working inside and outside of the Explorer, as well as building our own network tables and visualizations.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What observations did you make about Piozzi&rsquo;s network?</li>\n<li>How likely does it seem that travelers located in the same place at the same time would have interacted (based on the data and based on your own travel experience)?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>While a network model allows us to treat space as a node or edge, we may decide that our questions are best addressed by maintaining and representing “spatial data” as such. This is often the case for questions where space itself might be an important variable, as in the following questions:</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>Why did travelers tend to congregate in Turin?</li>\n<li>Did architects follow different itineraries than did artists?</li>\n<li>How many travelers reached the South of Italy, and where did they go?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Only by representing the spatial factor can we get a sense of how travelers followed or diverged from set itineraries. Similarly, space in visualizations can help to convey the experience of travel across real geography.</p>\n\n<p>“Geocoding” data refers to matching an object with a set of modern latitude and longitude coordinates. If we take a look at the Explorer, we see that the travels of individual travelers have been geocoded for us and are presented as a part of the dynamic map visualization (figs. 49, 50).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-49\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-49.png\" id=\"fig49\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap49&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap49\">\nFig. 49.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-50\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-50.png\" id=\"fig50\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap50&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap50\">\nFig. 50.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>If we export data and take a look at the Itineraries sheet, we see what this looks like in the data.

Measuring Addison’s Guidebook (30 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p>Scholars often cite the publication of Addison’s <em>Remarks on Several Parts of Italy</em> in 1705 as a foundational moment for the Grand Tour. Many travelers took Addison’s advice to heart and sought to travel to the places he indicated. Can we measure how closely later Grand Tourists followed Addison’s itinerary?</p>\n\n<p>Discussion:</p>\n\n<p>How could we operationalize this research question?</p>\n\n<p>There are many potential approaches. Today, we will experiment with map visualizations.</p>\n\n<p>Begin by subsetting the data in the Grand Tour Explorer for the “fifty years after” the first publication of Addison’s <em>Remarks</em> (1705–55). Open the Search page within the Explorer platform. Underneath the “Travel date” search field, select the option for “range of years.” Input “1705” for the start year and “1755” for the end year (fig. 52).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-52\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-52.png\" id=\"fig52\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap52&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap52\">\nFig. 52.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Export the results, and set up the Itineraries into a new Google Sheets document (fig. 53). Refer to Practicum 2 for more detailed steps for setting up data in Google Sheets.</p>\n\n<p>Note that these results represent all travels that started in 1705 or later OR ended in 1755 or earlier. This includes, for example, trips begun and ended in the 1680s. Different Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT, and AND NOT) can produce radically different results. If our goal is to compare travel after Addison’s publication to Addison’s itinerary, we will want to remove the travels that ended prior to the publication. Using sort or filters in Sheets, find and delete rows of travels with an end date equal to or before (i.e., less than) 1705. If you opt to use sort, remember to select Data &gt; Sort sheet rather than Data &gt; Sort range.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-53\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-53.png\" id=\"fig53\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap53&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap53\">\nFig. 53.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>To compare these travels to Joseph Addison’s, we will want to export the data for just Joseph Addison and add it to our Google Sheets. Returning to the Explorer search, input Joseph Addison in the Traveler name field. Export the results.</p>\n\n<p>To add Addison to our existing sheets, we can manually copy and paste the exported results into our existing Google Sheets. To add Addison’s trips, open, copy, and paste Addison Travelers_Itineraries.tsv to the bottom of the existing 1705–55 Itineraries sheet. Add a new column to the end of the data, and name it addisonCoordinates. Copy and paste the coordinates column values for just Joseph Addison into this new column (fig. 54) (we’ll see why in later steps).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-54\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-54.png\" id=\"fig54\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap54&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap54\">\nFig. 54.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Alternatively, we can import the data through Google Sheets. Open the Itineraries Sheet with our 1705–55 data, and navigate to File &gt; Import &gt; Upload, selecting the corresponding Addison Travelers_Itineraries.tsv file. In the “Import Location” dropdown, select “Append to Current Sheet.” Be sure to delete the duplicated header row featuring the column names. We will be working with a large amount of data, so you may wish to “trim” your tables in Google Sheets in advance, deleting any additional blank rows or columns.</p>\n\n<p>Once we have the data combined in our Google Sheets, we can import it into Palladio (fig. 55).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-55\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-55.png\" id=\"fig55\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap55&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap55\">\nFig. 55.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Input the Itineraries table, and title it “Addison’s and Later Itineraries” (fig. 56).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-56\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-56.png\" id=\"fig56\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap56&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap56\">\nFig. 56.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Navigate to the Map view in Palladio.

The parts can be dropped, modified, or divided into two sessions as best suits your audience and available time. Rather than provide an additional assignment, I would suggest working through, as far as time allows, and assigning the remaining parts for self-study.</em></p>\n\n<p>Reading:</p>\n\n<p>Edmund Warcupp, <em>Italy in its Original Glory</em> (1660): 247–60, https://wellcomecollection.org/works/k4de54th.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-1-introduction-10-min-2\">Part 1. Introduction (10 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p>Review:</p>\n\n<p>In the previous practicum we utilized coordinates to produce point maps and tested a hypothesis in which space was a significant variable. In this practicum, we will learn how to produce point-to-point maps, add geographic/chronological calculated fields, and visualize data from pivot tables.</p>\n\n<p>As we have learned from our primary sources, travel was highly “experiential.” Point maps can be helpful for analysis, but they can give the impression of teleportation from place to place. They also erase the difference between origin, intermediary, and destination locations. What if instead we wanted to preserve and display this information?</p>\n\n<p>We see one method of doing so in the Grand Tour Explorer: clicking “Animate” above the point maps provided for individual travelers (fig. 80).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-80\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-80.png\" id=\"fig80\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap80&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap80\">\nFig. 80.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>This animation relies on the travelIndex column in the Itineraries sheet, which provides a sequence reference (or “index”) for each trip along a traveler’s journey, starting from 1 for their first recorded location.</p>\n\n<p>Palladio allows us to create a “point-to-point map”; however, to do so, we will need to modify the Itineraries sheet. A point-to-point map is a type of network in which locations are connected by the sequence of travel. We will want our data to be more similar to our Edges table from our network activities (see Practicum 3).</p>\n\n<p>Until now, we have generally represented “undirected” networks, meaning networks where the first and second node are not playing significantly different roles. Now, however, we do want to distinguish them as the “origin location” and “destination location” in each case. We will be constructing a “directed, spatial network.” Another way of thinking about this is that we are “collapsing” the traveler into the edge, with two cities representing our nodes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-2-travelers-to-naples-30-min\">Part 2. Travelers to Naples (30 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p>How did travelers get to the south of Italy? Where did they visit? And how long did they stay there? Warcupp provides us with one answer, but let’s see if we can identify others in the data.</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>Let&rsquo;s begin by searching for &ldquo;everyone who traveled to Naples&rdquo; and exporting the resulting data (fig. 81).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-81\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-81.png\" id=\"fig81\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap81&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap81\">\nFig. 81.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n<li>Import the &ldquo;Itineraries&rdquo; TSV to Google Sheets. At the moment, each row represents &ldquo;a single location.&rdquo; We will need to modify each row somewhat so that instead of representing one place (a destination) it will represent two (an origin and destination). To put it another way, instead of each row representing a single point, it will represent the directed relationship between two points created by travel.</li>\n<li>Let&rsquo;s rename the travelPlace column to orgPlace. We will now want to add a column titled destPlace. Remember: you can always indicate that a value should be taken from a different cell by the simple formula &ldquo;=[A:Z]#.&rdquo; For example, in our new destPlace column in row 2, we can add a value from the orgPlace column in row 3 by calling &ldquo;=F3.&rdquo;</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>We only want to represent travel from point to point if both locations were visited by the same traveler and the same trip. Each traveler is represented by a different value in the Entry ID column, while each trip is sequenced from 1-n in the travelIndex column. We will use the “IF” function to indicate to Sheets to take a destPlace value ONLY if the travelIndex value in the following row is equal to the current row’s travelIndex value +1. The If function takes the following variables:</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>Logical expression: The condition that must be met. In this case, we will test that the next travelIndex follows this row&rsquo;s travelIndex sequentially, written as R3&nbsp;=&nbsp;R2+1.\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;\">\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em\">value_if_true: The operation we wish to perform if the condition is met, in this case, taking the value of the next row&rsquo;s orgPlace, written as F3.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;\">value_if_false: The operation we wish to perform if the condition is not met, in this case, a blank value. We can represent this by including the final comma and nothing after.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Still working in the second row of our sheet, change =F3 to the following formula into the destPlace cell: “=IF(R3=(R2+1),F3). Fill down the formula (figs. 82 and 83).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-82\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-82.png\" id=\"fig82\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap82&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap82\">\nFig. 82.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-83\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-83.png\" id=\"fig83\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap83&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap83\">\nFig. 83.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Why do we see so many FALSE cells? In some places, the traveler is only recorded as visiting a single destination. In other cases, the location is the end of a series of travels. And finally, some locations can’t be put in sequence owing to an absence of data.</p>\n\n<p>For mapping, we need separate coordinates for both the orgPlace and destPlace columns in the same row.</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>Rename the existing coordinates to &ldquo;orgCoordinates.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Create a new column titled destCoordinates. We will use a similar formula to the one we used before but call the value from the orgCoordinates column&mdash;that is, =IF(S3=(S2+1),H3) (fig. 84). <i>Note: If you move columns or create new columns in the sheet that change column order, you will need to change the column names of any new formulas to match.</i>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-84\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-84.png\" id=\"fig84\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap84&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap84\">\nFig. 84.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n<li>If we were to map this data as it stands, we would duplicate the end points of journeys. Let&rsquo;s remove the rows for which there is no destPlace.</li>\n<li>Now we will want to remove the end points for journeys. But filtering and deleting rows can sometimes freeze Sheets with this amount of data. Instead, try selecting the destPlace column and applying a filter (Filter: Data&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Create a Filter) (fig. 85).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-85\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-85.png\" id=\"fig85\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap85&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap85\">\nFig. 85.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n<li>Click the downwards facing arrow next to the column name, and Filter by condition&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Is not empty (fig. 86).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-86\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-86.png\" id=\"fig86\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap86&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap86\">\nFig. 86.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-3-pivot-tables-15-min\">Part 3.

Making sure the data range encompasses your full data, Insert: New Sheet (fig. 87).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-87\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/practicums/figure-87.png\" id=\"fig87\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap87&apos;))\" /> </a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\" id=\"cap87\">\nFig. 87.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The Pivot table editor will provide several suggestions of how we might summarize our data.

Often our base data will be too messy to produce visually legible results, but our summary tables are a different matter.</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>Select the data in the Pivot table sheet (CTRL&nbsp;+&nbsp;A or CMD&nbsp;+&nbsp;A).

How does this change both the Pivot table and chart?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-4-inferring-travel-time-20-min\">Part 4. Inferring Travel Time (20 Min.)</h2>\n\n<p>As we have seen in the primary sources, sometimes we are not sure how long travel actually took or what destinations an individual may have visited along the way that are not present in the data. How might we infer an amount of time for the travel between two locations?</p>\n\n<p>In this case, we can use two proxies in the data:</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>The endDate for an orgPlace value;</li>\n<li>The startDate for the destPlace, meaning the next orgPlace value.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>We can employ a handy formula within sheets called DATEDIF. This formula calculates the time between two dates in specified units. It takes the following variables:</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>Start_date: This will be the endDate of a given row (i.e., the date a traveler presumably began travel).</li>\n<li>End_date: This will be the startDate of the next row (i.e., the date a traveler presumably finished their travel, arriving in the next location).</li>\n<li>Unit: We can select from a number of string values (provided in the function documentation). For our purposes, let&rsquo;s work in terms of days, or &ldquo;D.&rdquo;</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Create a new column (next to column K) and title it travelSpan.

The only difference is that instead of calling a single value (such as a location name, or set of coordinates found in a different cell), if the travels are in sequence, we wish to perform the DATEDIF function, using the endDate and startDate values.</p>\n\n<p>We will find that some cells in our travelSpan column have the following error: “#NUM!.” Clicking on this error suggests that our startDate value for the next location occurs before the endDate value for the last. This is because if a date is not known to the day, it is input as the first day of a given month within the Explorer data. Hence, a traveler may leave a place on September 18 and appear to arrive at the next place on September 1.</p>\n\n<p>There isn’t always an easy solution for this type of data scarcity. We can work with the data we have, further hiding the errors.

What would you alter if you were to set up the data in a different way or choose different proxies?</p>\n\n<p>If you would like, set up a new Pivot Table with the data to find the average travel duration from Naples to other cities or from other cities to Naples. Remember: a first step will likely be setting the “Values” as the MEDIAN or AVERAGE of travelSpan.</p>\n\n<p>Discussion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Why do you sometimes get errors? What form do those errors take? What does it indicate to you about the data and its construction?</li>\n<li>How would you clean the data? What effects might this have on your conclusions?</li>\n<li>What was the longest travel span? The shortest? How accurate do you think our proxies are?

They have worked with a variety of methods and approaches—some choosing to annotate texts by hand to create new data, others writing code to run on large corpora. Mapping and network analysis remain enticing for many who are excited to use them on historical material. With these approaches, topics toward which students have gravitated include influence and networks and trying to understand better the logistics, the choices, and the experiences of travelers. Women travelers and matters related to gender have also interested many students. And in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, so has the topic of disease.</p>\n\n<p>The projects featured here are a selection chosen as representative of the broader body of student work produced in these classes. They do not represent fully realized research, but rather forays into unfamiliar subjects under the time constraints of an academic quarter. Yet the students’ creativity shines through in them, as does their general comfort with technology and data. For most students, an important discovery was the complexity of the records of the past and the thrill and courage of putting forward interpretation when faced with sources from a different, incomplete world. There was also a widespread desire among them to think about the limitations imposed by data categories, and to close the divide separating open from closed access, as well as digitized from forgotten material.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a gallery of work.

Tan charts the influence of the Dilettanti by analyzing its Explorer data in order to gain a macro perspective through the actions of its individual members, extrapolating on the larger data points of the group as a whole. Specifically, Tan compiles information on each of the fifty-five society members who are recorded to have been affiliated with societies beyond the Dilettanti, such as the Royal Society, Society of Antiquarians, Royal Academy, Royal Irish Academy, and the Free Society of Artists. Tan develops multiple data visualizations that explore the chronology of when each member joined various societies, the quantity of overlapping memberships, and the gaps in the data set to argue that the ability of the society to attract such valued people presents strong indicators pointing to the increasing influence that the society had during the eighteenth century. Incompleteness in the data set, however, such as missing information on important society leaders, presents a larger motivation for more complete and accurate data sets in the study of the digital history.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure1\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/studentswork/figure1.png\" id=\"fig1\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1\">\n\nFig 1.

Hoemeke does this by identifying gendered words and topics such as <em>cicisbeism</em>—a term for an attendant who served a woman, sometimes sexually—or female education, which was possibly more accessible in Italy than in England. Hoemeke compiled a list of gendered words found in Piozzi’s writing and used this to extract data from other tourists’ entries using the Grand Tour Explorer. Hoemeke records the city the traveler was in when they wrote the word or topic, the traveler’s gender, and the date of travel to create a visual representation of how, when, and where gendered topics were discussed. Furthermore, she spatially mapped the frequency of each gendered topic written about any city to reveal that Florence and Rome were, in her data, overwhelmingly represented as cities where travelers wrote about gender and gendered experiences. The number of mentions of <em>cicisbeo</em> in Florence supports the hypothesis that while cicisbeo might have been the most distinct feature of gender difference in Italy, it also acted as a vehicle for further discussion and analysis of the topic. Ultimately, this data shows that the experience of gender for travelers on the Grand Tour was one of exposure to new ideas of women’s freedoms.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure4\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/studentswork/figure4.png\" id=\"fig4\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap4&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\nFig. 4.

Kaplan-Lipkin asks, To what extent are classical references manifested in Piozzi’s writing, and how does she interact with the classical world on the Grand Tour? Is this different from her male peers? To pursue this question, Kaplan-Lipkin created a spreadsheet of every allusion Piozzi makes to a classical topic in her writings on Florence, noting the relevant quotation, a summary of what is being referenced, a category for the type of inspiration (e.g., art, text, etc.), whether the reference is mappable to a specific location, the location of the reference, and whether the reference is Greek or Roman. Once this information was compiled, Kaplan-Lipkin repeated the process with Dutens and Moore’s writings on Florence. In total, twenty-six mentions or allusions to classical antiquity were found across the three texts. Kaplan-Lipkin uploaded this data into Palladio to map these data points onto Florence. The visualizations helped clarify that while Dutens and Moore’s classical references were mostly inspired by their visits to the Uffizi gallery, Piozzi sees allusions to the classical world all across the city and through personal encounters. Piozzi’s writings point to a worldview influenced heavily by an orientation toward the past and references Hellenism much more than those of her peers. Piozzi is also the most diverse in her allusions, referencing art, mythology, literature, and religion while her peers mostly allude to classical art.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure7\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/studentswork/figure7.png\" id=\"fig7\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap7\">\n\nFig. 7.

The Royal Academy of London, established in 1768, sought to promote the advancement of visual arts education and exhibition; and equal numbers of historical, portrait, and landscape painters among its founding members reflects the rising prominence of the classically resonant genre in the British arts scene. This academy counted many former Grand Tourists among its thirty-six founding members, most notably the first president and portrait painter Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–92). To assess “influence,” Francis and Megregian focus on evidence of landscape-painting interest from the social networks and linguistic trends of select Royal Academy Grand Tourists, as well as broader geospatial and network trends among all Royal Academy painters identified through the Grand Tour Explorer database. Megregian employs the NLP technique of word2vec on Joshua Reynolds’s Archive.org digitized corpus of thirty documents that range from his Italian sketchbooks to Royal Academy presidential addresses and private correspondences to identify contextual trends in his writing. She also performed geospatial analysis in Palladio and Python to identify what cities future Royal Academy members traveled to with the highest frequency. Francis investigated network analysis through producing Python visualizations of the relationship between the twenty-three Royal Academy/Grand Tour painters and their Grand Tour Explorer (GTE) Matched Mentions. She also cross-referenced Richard Wilson’s GTE entry with his Matched and Unmatched Mentions to generate a set of Palladio graphs of his social network developed during the Grand Tour. Using breadth of digital humanities methods, Francis and Megregian identify positive relationships between the Grand Tour and rise of British landscape painting, while also encountering limits, both in terms of the Explorer data—wishing similar records existed for artists of different nationalities—and of digitized corpora—wishing more digitized sources existed for artists beyond Reynolds.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure9\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/studentswork/figure9.png\" id=\"fig9\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap9&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap9\">\n\nFig. 9.

Focusing on primary sources written by Hester Piozzi, Anne Miller, Thomas Watkins, and Tobias Smollett, Pincus analyzes the narratives each wrote about their time in Florence through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), detecting word and phrase patterns within each text. Interested in differences between female and male authors, Pincus assigned Hester Piozzi and Anne Miller to one file and Thomas Watkins and Tobias Smollett to another and then used Orange3 to identify the top five topics within each file. Some differences were immediately apparent. Only the results from the “Female Author” group attest a gendered term that does not refer to men. Furthermore, the word <em>us</em> appears in the results of the “Female Author” group three times, whereas it appears zero times in the results of the “Male Author” group. Also, an MDS diagram visualizes how the female authors were much more likely to write about a variety of topics, whereas the men had a more limited range. Pincus theorizes that this might be because men had a more scripted travel experience on the Grand Tour, while women, remarkably, had less social pressure to study classical antiquities and, thus, more freedom to consider multiple topics. Pincus notes the irony, however, that this authorial freedom for women originates from their exclusion; the concept of a proper Grand Tour was encouraged for young men, not young women. The data supports this idea, as the Grand Tour Explorer contains database logs that 1,242 men traveled to Florence, whereas only 283 women traveled there. Pincus suggests that further research could be done by enlarging the data set to include more writers and to explore how rather than treating gender as binary, a more in-depth research project could assume gender as a spectrum instead.</p>\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure11\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/studentswork/figure11.png\" id=\"fig11\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap11&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap11\">\n\nFig. 11.

Building on previous research by Sánchez-Jáuregui, Ta hypothesizes that with information from the Grand Tour Explorer database, it is possible to map the edges of tutor’s social networks and discover how extensive these networks really were. Ta searched the database for employment identifiers and occupations, compiling sixteen entries for individual tutors. She defined an extensive network by the number of tours they led, as well as the number of nonunique locations visited on their travels. In developing a scatterplot and other Palladio visualizations, Ta found there is a positive correlation between traveling extensively and being well-connected. For example, Ta writes, Richard Phelps, who led five tours, became acquainted with architects, painters, and statesmen, eventually gaining membership into the Society of Dilettanti. And in the visualization of tutors’ social networks, there are some shared connections between tutors, showing that their social circles overlapped. The social networks of tutors offered the possibility of advancement as many tutors went on to become diplomats or secretaries.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure13\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/studentswork/figure13.png\" id=\"fig13\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap13&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap13\">\n\nFig. 13.

Benitez gathers the textual evidence recorded in the Explorer entries from travelers such as George Parker and Jonathan Richardson the Younger, both of whom write about how the plague impacted their travels. Parker documented how Venice required testimonials from a doctor to enter during the years of the disease, and Richardson detailed how he did not go to Venice, traveling to Rome instead, owing to disease. Benitez then turns to data, compiling information on 329 Grand Tour travelers during the 1710–33 period. Using Palladio, Benitez creates three maps to highlight travel patterns of the three periods before, during, and after the plague. These maps visually depict how during the time period of the plague, travel decreased to Venice and increased to Rome. This decrease, Benitez argues, can be attributed to the fear of the plague and the quarantine measures put into place by the city of Venice, making it difficult for foreigners to enter without the proper medical paperwork. This information can be used to better understand the history of modern health practices and their impacts on people moving across borders.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure15\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/studentswork/figure15.png\" id=\"fig15\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap15&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap15\">\n\nFig. 15.

Many travelers on the Grand Tour had few contacts with other travelers, and for many, gaps between social groups were often bridged by art collectors, dealers, and to a lesser extent merchants, scholars, and soldiers. Gibbons, however, offers a meaningful account of social influence in his letters, which establish that those of the same social class, over the weeks they would be in the same location, were brought together by mutual acquaintance, letters of introduction, or presentation at court. This suggests that institutional affiliation played a central role in who spent time with whom. To create a more sophisticated lens on who bridged social groups, Armstrong constructs a visual network that reflects the influence of certain travelers on others, based on how many life experiences they share. To measure this, Armstrong designs a metric of similarity called affinity. Two people have an affinity if they share a life event: being married, going to the same school, being a general, or being part of the same social circles, for example. One affinity is represented as one edge between two nodes, where each node is a person. Armstrong utilized the full Grand Tour Explorer database and filtered only for dates from 1764 to 1765, the dates of Gibbon’s travel, which included twelve hundred entries. The affinity graph reveals that many travelers have very low affinity scores, and few have extremely large affinities. Armstrong concludes that there are deep qualitative differences in travelers Grand Tour experiences and social networks.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure17\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/studentswork/figure17.png\" id=\"fig17\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap17&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap17\">\n\nFig. 17.

Utilizing data on how long travelers stayed in various locations across Italy and cross-referencing it with written accounts of those places by the travelers provides a glimpse into the perceptual landscape of Italy in the eighteenth century. To compare the shifting perceptions of place, Francis divided his analysis into four time intervals: before 1725, 1725 to 1750, 1750 to 1775, and 1775 onward. To correlate travelers’ length of stay with appreciation, he developed a metric based on the proportion of time spent in each location in their itinerary and the number of standard deviations of each proportion from the mean of all proportions. To analyze travel accounts in Adam Matthew Digital’s (AMD) Grand Tour database, Francis designed an algorithm to search transcripts for place names and then pull the twenty words preceding and following the location name for analysis. Francis looked for Grand Tourists who were both present in the Grand Tour Explorer and had text present in the AMD database. After scraping the databases and finding five matches, Francis used logistic regression, support vector machines, and an MLP neural network to find the data results. With results accuracy at 70 percent, more research is needed. Yet Francis’s data analysis of the perceptual landscape of eighteenth-century Italy confirms scholarly analysis that the perceptions of locations on the Grand Tour shifted during the long eighteenth century.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure20\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/studentswork/figure21.png\" id=\"fig20\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap20&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap20\">\n\nFig. 20.

Employing network theory to understand the dealers’ sphere of influence over the art market in the eighteenth century, Jones questions how these men shaped not only the British taste in art but also how we think about the origins and provenance of antiquities today. The network operates through three main “layers.” The first layer of the network is formed by finding all the connection points between the four dealers and the database, followed by a search within the more than six thousand entries of the Grand Tour database for any connection points based on names mentioned in their biographical entries. The third layer repeats that process again for the second layer to attempt to prevent bias. Focusing on degree of network and betweenness centrality, the visual data reveals that W. Hamilton, Jenkins, Byres, and G. Hamilton appear in the top four nodes with highest betweenness centrality. By these metrics, it is clear that these four individuals played a major part not only in the network but also in the art and antiquities market during the Grand Tour. Furthermore, Jones focuses on Sir William Hamilton to explore his political and cultural relations. For example, the sale of Hamilton’s collection formed the basis of the British Museum’s original antiquities collection. By amassing such an important collection, Hamilton ransacked archaeological sites and burial grounds, smuggling vases and other artifacts of importance across borders. Still today, Hamilton’s methods of collecting have left scars as his practice set a precedent for other dealers to steal and smuggle as seen most recently by billionaire Michael Steinhardt’s trial, which seized more than 180 stolen antiquities.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure22\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../../assets/images/ch-6/studentswork/figure-22.png\" id=\"fig-22\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap22&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap22\">\n\nFig. 22.

        "content"  : "<p>The class I teach about eighteenth-century travel to Italy using the Grand Tour Explorer is titled “Virtual Italy: Methods for Historical Data Science.” It is an undergraduate class, upper-division by catalog number, but regularly also attracting some first-year students who thrive in it regardless. By a mix of general requirements that the class satisfies and, I want to also imagine, by word of mouth or interest, it attracts both dedicated humanities students and computer- or data-science students. This mix is constructive, adding to the learning environment in discussion and project work alike.</p>\n\n<p>I offer here a few notes on what has worked well in my experience, as well as a stripped-down syllabus built around the quarter system (which is short!), with two eighty-minute weekly classes.</p>\n\n<p>The course description emphasizes the importance of reading and original project-based work using a variety of technologies but requiring no prior coursework. It makes clear the weekly structure: one day for lecture/reading/discussion of eighteenth-century travel, the other day focused on technology, with weekly assignments that build on the previous class’s readings. It also states that the making of the final project is supported step-by-step, from proposal to final presentation, starting with the midterm, and that much class time is to be dedicated to working on the project. A written submission, alongside visualization and a presentation, is expected for the final project. Group final projects are encouraged.</p>\n\n<p>A visit to the library special collections to see and hold manuscripts and printed eighteenth-century travel accounts has always been an important part of the class, making concrete what the records of the past consist of and the materiality of recording travel. This component can work even in the absence of a rare books room populated by eighteenth-century travels, especially given the close relationship between the emergence of the museum as a signature modern institution and the world of Grand Tour travel. Even guided online searches for objects and books serve the students well. While some eighteenth-century collections remain proprietary—and the Adam Matthew Digital Grand Tour website, for example, is an expensive one that not every library can afford—more and more is becoming accessible in open access.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a basic syllabus:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Readings</th>\n      <th>Class content</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Week 1: Introduction</b></td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td>Introduction to class, syllabus review</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td>Practicum 1: Examples of DH projects and intro to the Grand Tour Explorer (GTE)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Week 2: What was the Grand Tour?</b></td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>J.

What new light could the Explorer cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the Explorer tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body? The dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste, acquired and polished in Italy, exercised such a powerful influence upon Britain’s eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.2 But it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic grand tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out throughout my book was the increasing presence of both female travelers and travelers from beyond the landed elite over the course of the eighteenth century, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book: Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile: such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa and Leghorn.</p>\n"

What new light could the Explorer cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the Explorer tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body? \n\nThe dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste&mdash;acquired and polished in Italy&mdash;exercised a powerful influence on Britain&rsquo;s eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.[^2] But it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic Grand Tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out in my book was the increasing presence over the course of the eighteenth century both of female travelers and of travelers from beyond the landed elite, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book&mdash;Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice&mdash;I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution and on the significance of other centers with a lower profile, such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa, and Leghorn/Livorno. \n\nMy initial approach was very basic: looking at patterns of travel and the relative popularity (in terms of numbers of visitors rather than length of stay) of individual cities. Figures 1 and 2 show the number of travelers to individual cities by decade: [figure 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled#figure-1\") shows the five most popular cities; [figure 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled#figure-2) shows the ten most popular cities.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"../sweet-figure-1.svg\" id=\"fig1\" onload=\"resize(this, getElementById(&apos;fig2&apos;))\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig2&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap12&apos;))\"/> </a> <a name=\"figure-2\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"../sweet-figure-2.svg\" id=\"fig2\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig1&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap12&apos;), true)\"/> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap12\">\n\nFigs. 1 and 2. Stacked area charts showing the numbers of travelers by start year of travel to selected cities. The top five cities bear out many known patterns; however, the addition of the next five cities complicates the picture of rising and falling traveler numbers. Note that the number of travelers has been aggregated by decade. This has been done for readability, as absent data prevents perfect continuous representation by individual year. (For another strategy, see the use of a moving average trend line in <a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival\">Rachel Midura&rsquo;s essay</a>.)\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe data helps to clarify what most of us who have studied the Grand Tour without engaging in any quantitative analysis knew anyway: that travel declined in times of war&mdash;most strikingly in the 1740s, during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740&ndash;48), and to a lesser extent during the American War of Independence (1775&ndash;83); that Naples was increasingly popular as a destination in the latter half of the century; and that Rome was the most frequented city by a large margin. The data also confirms that numbers of travelers increased significantly after the Peace of Paris (1763) and that travel did not immediately stop after the outbreak of the French Revolution (1789). Beyond the main four cities (and initially Padua), cities such as Bologna, Genoa, and Milan showed more or less the same pattern: a small but steady increase in numbers, particularly after 1760, until a stabilization or decline at the very end of the century. Although new areas were added to the tour of Italy&mdash;notably south of Naples in the late eighteenth century&mdash;Padua was the only destination that saw a clear decline in significance in the itineraries of British travelers over the course of the eighteenth century. \n\nThe dominance of Naples over Florence in the last two decades of the century is a striking feature. Again, one might have inferred this from the comments of visitors in journals, letters, and topographical literature: enthusiasm for Naples and the warm south increased as anxiety about its dangers and licentiousness diminished, whereas the charms of Florence were felt more keenly earlier in the century. Meanwhile, the rediscovery of medieval and early Renaissance Florence&mdash;the version of the city that would so charm the Victorians&mdash;had yet to be made.[^3] Similarly, although Venice was always one of the most important destinations of the Italian tour, the data suggests that it was overtaken in popularity by Florence and Naples during the second half of the century until the last decade. There are a number of reasons why this might have been the case: first, and most pragmatically, while both Florence and Naples were centers where British tourists were happy to reside for weeks or even months, Venice was a city through which visitors passed much more swiftly, seldom spending more than a week or two. There is therefore a higher chance that visits went unrecorded. The relative downward trend in Venice&rsquo;s appeal is borne out by more qualitative comments, the tenor of which showed increasing awareness of Venice&rsquo;s decline and a greater inclination to find fault with the city&rsquo;s appearance, its society, and its virtue. In the 1790s, however, when visitor numbers in other cities were falling, numbers in Venice (and to a lesser extent to Padua) increased: a shift that reflects the geopolitics of the time as travelers were funneled out of Italy through the Austrian Tyrol rather than through enemy France.[^4] \n\nThe most striking point, however, is the dominance of Padua in the early eighteenth century. Indeed, during the first decade of the eighteenth century we know of more travelers in Padua than in any other city, Rome included. In the second decade, the number was equal to those in Rome; by the third decade, Padua appears to have been losing its dominance; and by midcentury, it had become, apparently, a relatively unimportant destination on the British Grand Tour. In general terms, this broad outline bears out what we know already: the reputation of Padua&rsquo;s medieval university was in decline during the eighteenth century; it was not a contemporary hub of major artistic or cultural production, nor was it a political or religious center. \n\nBeyond that, this data highlights one of the problems with the archival base of *A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy, 1701&ndash;1800*, compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells (1997), which is carried over in the Explorer.[^5] A key source for the compilers of the *Dictionary* was the register of matriculation at the [University in Padua](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/search/%7B%22entry%22:%7B%22terms%22:%5B%7B%22value%22:%22university%20of%20padua%22,%22beginning%22:true,%22end%22:true%7D%5D,%22sections%22:%5B%7B%22key%22:%22biography%22,%22name%22:%22Biography%22,%22checked%22:true,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12578%22%7D,%7B%22key%22:%22narrative%22,%22name%22:%22Narrative%22,%22checked%22:true,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12579%22%7D,%7B%22key%22:%22tours%22,%22name%22:%22Tours%22,%22checked%22:true,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12580%22%7D,%7B%22key%22:%22notes%22,%22name%22:%22Notes%22,%22checked%22:true,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12581%22%7D%5D,%22operator%22:%22or%22%7D%7D), which visitors in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries made a point of signing.[^6] As Ingamells explained in his introduction to the *Dictionary*, this source allowed the compilers of the *Dictionary* to document visitors passing through Padua early in the century more completely than for most other cities. But the declining numbers that we see from the 1730s also correspond with a decline in the practice of signing the register: the last signature was recorded in 1765.[^7] This does not mean that visitors were no longer passing through the city; it simply shows that there was no longer a single source of evidence to verify their presence. Thus, the reliability of the *Dictionary* in noting visits to lesser cities is, unsurprisingly, less consistent. \n\nThis point, of course, applies to any city where visitors spent days rather than weeks, and it reflects the interests of those compiling the *Dictionary*, whose agenda was the history of art and collecting, as well as the examination of the social networks of those who were engaged in shaping taste and exercising patronage. The experience of travel per se was not their driving concern. For example, the visit to Padua by the Norwich merchant [Robert Harvey](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2294) (1753&ndash;1820, travel year 1773) was undocumented in the *Dictionary*; however, his journal records that he became stuck in the mud outside Padua and spent the following day wandering around &ldquo;this large, straggling, ill built, ancient city with arcades said to have been built by Antenor, whose tomb they pretend to show you.&rdquo;[^8] Yet the *Dictionary* entry has him proceeding from Rome to Venice, in common with many other entries, with no mention of any of the intervening cities. \n\nNumbers of visitors to all cities increased in the 1760s, but the spike for Turin is particularly noticeable; moreover, the increase was not sustained subsequently, whereas in other cities numbers of visitors continued on an upward trend. The pattern becomes clearer if we look at Turin in isolation ([fig. 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled#figure-3)). \n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../sweet-figure-3.svg\"  onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;), true)\"/> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap3\">\n\nFig. 3. Number of travelers as counted by start year of travel to Turin. The chart shows the anomalous spike in numbers of travelers between 1761 and 1770.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nTurin&rsquo;s geographical situation ensured its importance as a center for travelers, being the first major city for those who approached Italy via the Mt. Cenis Pass. Travelers conventionally stayed there for at least a couple of days, if not longer, to recover from the rigors of the journey and admire the view of the mountains they had so recently traversed. As the &ldquo;bear leader,&rdquo; [Joseph Spence](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4469) (1699&ndash;1768, years of travel 1731&ndash;33, and 1739&ndash;41), informed his mother: &ldquo;The view we have from the ramparts is the prettiest and the most extraordinary I ever saw in my life, for on one side you see the Alps, rugged and all covered with snow, and on the other the most beautiful hills sprinkled with little country seats, vineyards, fine clumps of wood, and the Po, running at the bottom of them.&rdquo;[^9] The presence of the court, reckoned by Spence &ldquo;one of the politest in Europe,&rdquo;[^10] was always an attraction, as were the royal art collections, the university, and the formal symmetry, regularity, and monumentality of the new town. The dramatic surge in visitors in the 1760s is therefore somewhat puzzling. \n\nThe spike in visitors might well reflect the vagaries of the evidence compiled for the *Dictionary* and the idiosyncrasies of principles for inclusion, but it could also be occasioned by shifts in Alpine travel, as discussed by [Rachel Midura]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival/). One further reason for the attraction of Turin to British visitors is worth consideration: the Royal Academy (*Reale Accademia di Savoia*), reorganized by the king of Sardinia in 1729 for the education of the European elite and a key destination for many of the aristocratic youth, who stayed there for months at a time with their tutors. Young elite men attended the Accademia (and other similar academies throughout Europe) to perfect physical skills such as horsemanship, fencing, or dancing and to be taught subjects such as fortifications and mathematics.[^11] \n\nYoung men and foreigners, advised [Thomas Martyn](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3215) (1735&ndash;1825, travel years 1779&ndash;80), could be trained there at moderate expense because the king defrayed part of the cost.[^12] The value for money emphasized by Martyn may not have been the deciding factor for aristocratic parents like the 10th Earl of Pembroke [Henry Herbert](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3799) (1734&ndash;92, travel years 1753&ndash;55, 1768&ndash;69, 1784&ndash;86, 1789), who hoped rather that his &ldquo;tall, lank and bony&rdquo; offspring [George Augustus Herbert](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2363), 11th Earl of Pembroke (1759&ndash;1827, travel years 1779&ndash;80), would benefit from &ldquo;some attention to person, &amp; Grace&rdquo; at the Accademia.[^13] \n\nAnalyzing visitor numbers by age indicates that, of the visitors that are known to have visited Turin, more youths were recorded here than in other cities, such as Rome. Using their birth dates, I identified the number of travelers per decade who were between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five at time of travel.[^14] This is an approximate exercise given that only around 41 percent of the entries have confirmed birth dates (fig. 5). It is likely, however, that the majority of those whose birth dates are recorded would have been members of the aristocratic elite whose lives in general are so much better documented. The peaks in terms of the presence of travelers in Turin designated as &ldquo;youths&rdquo; based on this criteria can be related to those identified by Paola Bianchi in terms of attendance at the Accademia by British noblemen and their tutors.[^15] Bianchi&rsquo;s data shows that the Accademia was at its most popular among the British aristocratic elite during the period 1745 to 1765, a pattern that calls for comparison with what the Explorer data shows (fig. 4).[^16] \n\n<a name=\"figure-4\"></a>\n\n| Years   | Number of British |\n|:--------|------------------:|\n| 1733    |                 3 |\n| 1736-40 |                15 |\n| 1741-45 |                16 |\n| 1746-50 |                35 |\n| 1751-55 |                14 |\n| 1756-60 |                30 |\n| 1761-65 |                21 |\n| 1766-70 |                19 |\n| 1771-75 |                13 |\n| 1776-79 |                11 |\n| 1784-85 |                 3 |\n| 1786-90 |                 4 |\n\n<figure>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n    \nFig. 4.

Although exact ages are not given, their enrollment in this educational institution signals their youth. Reproduced from Bianchi, &ldquo;In cerca del moderno,&rdquo; 1032.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe usual caveat regarding the inherent aristocratic bias of the *Dictionary* applies: the elite young men who attended the Accademia are precisely those whose travels are recorded in most detail. Moreover, their presence in Turin was the more noticeable because as students of the Accademia they generally spent a period of months rather than days or weeks in the city, in contrast to the travelers who stayed only a couple of days before moving onward. \n\nThe number of these &ldquo;classic&rdquo; Grand Tourists (meaning elite, young men) recorded in Turin can therefore be approached as reasonably accurate. Yet it should be noted that Bianchi&rsquo;s data, drawn from the records of attendees at the Accademia in the Treasury archives of Turin, includes eighty names of young men, their companions, and their tutors, whose presence in Turin is not recorded in the *Dictionary*. In any case&mdash;and possibly also because of the different divisions of time in Bianchi (five-year versus ten-year intervals)&mdash;there is not an exact match in peak numbers between the Explorer&rsquo;s data and that of Bianchi.[^17] \n\n<a name=\"figure-5a\"> </a>\n\n| Decade | Travelers to Italy (Known Birth Date) | Percentage of Whom Were Young Men | Travelers to Turin | Percentage of Whom Were Young Men | Travelers to Rome | Percentage of Whom Were Young Men |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1701-10 | 170                                         | 60.59         | 35                       | 40.00            | 181                     | 32.04         |\n| 1711-20 | 194                                         | 45.36         | 74                       | 29.73         | 243                     | 23.87         |\n| 1721-30 | 223                                         | 43.50          | 50                       | 24.00            | 425                     | 18.82         |\n| 1731-40 | 280                                         | 48.57         | 123                      | 40.65         | 395                     | 22.28         |\n| 1741-50 | 215                                         | 42.79         | 50                       | 36.00            | 191                     | 27.75         |\n| 1751-60 | 278                                         | 46.40          | 91                       | 45.05         | 333                     | 28.53         |\n| 1761-70 | 382                                         | 46.86         | 245                      | 27.35         | 454                     | 25.33         |\n| 1771-80 | 401                                         | 35.41         | 123                      | 20.33         | 550                     | 18.18         |\n| 1781-90 | 353                                         | 31.44         | 140                      | 18.57         | 566                     | 13.25         |\n| 1791-1800 | 284                                         | 30.28         | 86                       | 17.44         | 463                     | 14.04         |\n\n<figure>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap5\">\n\nFig. 5.

Towner argued that the high point of the typical Grand Tour was in the mid-eighteenth century and began to tail off thereafter as other types of travelers (Towner&rsquo;s &ldquo;middle classes&rdquo;) increased.[^18] The detailed picture offered by the Explorer data is rather more interesting. The numbers&mdash;particularly in Rome and Naples, two of the most popular cities for which most information survives&mdash;continued to be higher than in the earlier part of the century. That said, as a proportion of the total number of travelers, the young men were becoming less significant. Meanwhile, a snapshot of those whom we know to have been &ldquo;middle-aged&rdquo; (i.e., between forty and fifty) shows that their numbers per decade roughly doubled over the course of the century (fig. 6). \n\n<a name=\"figure-6\"> </a>\n\n| Decade    | Total Number of Travelers (Known Birth Date) | Number of Middle-Aged Men | Middle-Aged Men \\% |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 1701-10 | 170                                         | 15                        | 8.82              |\n| 1711-20 | 194                                         | 25                        | 12.89             |\n| 1721-30 | 223                                         | 28                        | 12.56             |\n| 1731-40 | 280                                         | 38                        | 13.57             |\n| 1741-50 | 215                                         | 25                        | 11.63             |\n| 1751-60 | 278                                         | 27                        | 9.71              |\n| 1761-70 | 382                                         | 53                        | 13.87             |\n| 1771-80 | 401                                         | 58                        | 14.46             |\n| 1781-90 | 353                                         | 61                        | 17.28             |\n| 1791-1800 | 284                                         | 55                        | 19.37             |\n\n<figure>\n\n<figcaption>\n    \nFig. 6.

When mentioned, women were generally overshadowed by their male traveling companions: even [Harriet Carr](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/817) (1771&ndash;1848, travel years 1791&ndash;94), the amateur artist and traveling companion of her brother, [John Carr](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/819) (1764&ndash;1817, travel years 1791&ndash;94), on whose journals most of the article on her brother&rsquo;s travels was based, merited only a minimal entry in the *Dictionary*, yet she now has an entry of her own in the Explorer.[^19] The numerous wives, sisters, and daughters (often unnamed) who accompanied other travelers were even harder to detect; a similar problem hindered locating younger brothers and younger sons, servants, and many other unnamed fellow travelers. Many of these individuals have now been extracted from the records and given an entry in their own right in the Explorer. Yet the compilers of the *Dictionary* never set out comprehensively to record these &ldquo;lesser&rdquo; individuals, so despite the best efforts of those involved in the Explorer to overcome the aristocratic male bias, it is impossible to make visible those whose existence is not even mentioned in the *Dictionary*&mdash;a point taken up also by [Simon Macdonald]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholars-essays/macdonald-harlequin-horsemanship). \n\n\nAlthough the data will always remain frustratingly incomplete, the general trend illustrated in [figure 7]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled#figure-7) shows a marked increase in female travelers during the last three decades of the eighteenth century. Taken with the increasing numbers of older male travelers, this data helps to provide firmer substance to the generalized assertions of an increasingly diverse traveling community by the last decades of the eighteenth century. The first woman to publish on travel to Italy was [Lady Anne Miller](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3324) (1741&ndash;81, travel year 1770&ndash;71), whose *Letters from Italy* appeared, to a mixed reception from the public, in 1776.[^20] Notwithstanding some stinging criticism from [Horace Walpole](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4974) (1717&ndash;97, travel years 1739&ndash;41) and others, Lady Miller&rsquo;s *Letters* enjoyed considerable popularity; subsequently, other female travelers, such as [Hester Thrale Piozzi](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3880) (1741&ndash;1821, travel years 1784&ndash;86) and [Mariana Starke](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4512) (c. 1762&ndash;1839, travel years 1792&ndash;98), followed suit in publishing their own observations.[^21] The increasing numbers of female travelers and travel writers in the later eighteenth century&mdash;domestically, in Europe, and further afield&mdash;has rightly attracted recent scholarly attention.[^22] But it is also important to acknowledge the presence of women *before* the 1770s, now revealed by the Explorer, and to be mindful that not all of them were the long-term resident wives of diplomats or merchants. These underrecorded women may not have engaged in the traditional pedagogic program of the Grand Tour or shared in all the cultural experiences that are traditionally held to have defined it, but they were in Italy, experiencing all the differences of cultural and social life that that implies, enduring the physical hardship and discomfort of foreign travel and contributing to and sharing in the experiences of their male companions.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-7\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../sweet-figure-7.svg\"  onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;), true)\"/> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap7\">\n\nFig. 7. Stacked area chart showing the numbers of female travelers by decade of start year of travel and showing an overall pattern of increasing presence of women on the Grand Tour across the century. \n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nConsidering together the age profile and the numbers of women traveling&mdash;flawed though the data necessarily is&mdash;what patterns emerge? [Figure 8]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled#figure-8) compares the number of female travelers against the number of male youth and men of middle age and of unspecified age. The most striking point to emerge is that from the 1770s, the numbers of women rivaled those of young men traveling in Italy. As I have already noted, the data, particularly with regard to ages, is incomplete, but it does demonstrate the degree to which patterns of travel had changed by the last two decades of the century. The Grand Tour was increasingly being undertaken by families and groups of mixed ages and genders, whose presence comes across clearly in the more qualitative evidence of journals and correspondence. \n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-8\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"../sweet-figure-8.svg\"  onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap8&apos;), true)\"/> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap8\">\n\nFig. 8. Stacked area chart showing the numbers of men, women, and subset of young men among travelers. By 1771-1780, the number of female travelers had outpaced the number of young men. \n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe changing social profile of travelers was also one of social background and class. This is harder to pursue through the Explorer, again owing to the limited data for the nonaristocratic elite. The largest single &ldquo;Occupations &amp; Posts Group&rdquo; category on the Grand Tour Explorer is that of statesman or politician (884 individuals) followed by the army and navy (291 individuals), confirming the image of the Grand Tour as the training ground of the future social, political, and military elite. That said, the statesmen and politicians were precisely those people whose careers are easiest for historians to trace. Only 1,486 of the individuals in the *Dictionary* were assigned explicit occupations and posts, leaving the majority (4,486) without. The &ldquo;Employment and Identifier&rdquo; category offers another approach, but with its [own caveats]({{ site.baseurl }}/the-grand-tour-explorer/explanation).\n\nTwo natural subsets for considering the &ldquo;nonelite&rdquo; traveler might be the clergy and merchants; however, they are each difficult to consider independently from other Grand Tourists for different reasons. Aristocratic young men were almost always accompanied by tutors who were very often members of the clergy, such as the [Reverend Joseph Spence](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/4469) (1699&ndash;1768, travel years 1731&ndash;33, 1739&ndash;41), whose comments on Turin&mdash;from two separate tours that he made in the company of, respectively, the [Earl of Middlesex](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/3305) (1711&ndash;69, travel years 1731&ndash;33, 1736&ndash;38) and the [Earl of Lincoln](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/explorer/#/entries/2956) (1720&ndash;94, travel years 1739&ndash;41)&mdash;have already been quoted. Merchants are a reasonably numerous category to consider (157 individuals are identified as merchants), but the results of this exercise are skewed by the inclusion of long-term residents in the *Dictionary*, such as the merchants from the English factory at Leghorn/Livorno, who are discussed in the essays by [Reinert]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholars-essays/reinert-economic-grand-tour) and [Macdonald]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholars-essays/macdonald-harlequin-horsemanship). A number of merchants from Britain did travel, sometimes using the occasion to visit foreign business partners as the opportunity to partake of the wider cultural experience offered by Italy; however, merchants were much more likely to be semipermanent residents of various Italian ports.[^23] Similarly, there was a preponderance of clergy in Rome, which reflects the centrality of Rome to the tour. But for the clergy more than for any other group, Rome would have been a particularly significant destination, given that most clergymen would have enjoyed a rigorously classical education and many had a professional interest in the history of the Christian church. While these groups often had professional ties to the Grand Tour, they complicate our idea of a &ldquo;traveler&rdquo; on tour. \n\nIt is, in fact, relatively difficult to use the Explorer to investigate the social backgrounds of travelers from beyond the landed elite. This is due to the limitations of the information in the original *Dictionary*, the inconsistency with which it was recorded by the compilers (for whom documenting social change within the traveling community was not a primary concern), and the blurred lines within British society that separated members of the landed, professional, and mercantile classes. Towner&rsquo;s assertion of higher levels of middle-class participation is perhaps more emphatic than the data of the Explorer suggests; while there is an inherent aristocratic bias in the Explorer, Towner&rsquo;s methodology of analyzing published tours similarly has an inbuilt bias toward the middle classes, who were far more likely than the aristocracy and landed elite to enter into print.[^24]\n\nOne of the great pleasures of using the *Dictionary* is discovering the wealth of extraordinarily diverse information that it records within the limits of multiple biographical entries, which cumulatively constitute a uniquely detailed history of eighteenth-century travel. In its print version, it is unwieldy to use systematically (although a number of researchers claim to have read it cover to cover). The Explorer, however, makes this information fully discoverable for the first time: as this essay has attempted to show, evolving itineraries or the changing composition of the traveling community by age and gender can be delineated with a far greater degree of confidence than is possible simply through more qualitative analysis. The shortcomings of the data, however, discussed in the [introduction](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/entering-a-world-made-by-travel), must always render the conclusions provisional: as this essay has also shown, the questions that researchers may ask of the data are not necessarily those that the compilers had in mind when writing the entries, and this has a bearing on the results that the Explorer generates. Nonetheless, the Explorer makes it possible to establish with far greater confidence than ever before who was traveling where and when, providing thereby the framework around which a much more nuanced history of the experience of travel in Italy may be written.\n\n<div class=\"dataButton\" onclick=\"window.open('https://purl.stanford.edu/mz598ph0356','mywindow');\">Download and explore the data behind this essay</div>\n\n# Notes\n\n[^1]: Rosemary Sweet, *Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c. 1690&ndash;1820* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012). \n\n[^2]: Bruce Redford, *Venice and the Grand Tour* (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1996).

That statement is often greeted by polite confusion. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a contradiction in terms?&rdquo; a student or colleague will ask. They imagine a mill-powered computer or knights moonlighting as information technology consultants.\n\nI have learned to love these questions because they open a portal to many others: why does it seem like a contradiction? What does that say about our assumptions regarding premodern history or digital technologies? These conversations bring assumptions into the open air like so much dirty laundry. The truth is that history and the &ldquo;digital&rdquo; are often perceived as opposite ends of the trajectory of progress. History describes eons of stability, scarce information, and largely inaccurate knowledge. The &ldquo;digital&rdquo; age on the other hand is both our present and future: ever-changing, so overloaded with information it often defies individual comprehension, and only navigable with the aid of technology smarter than humans. These characterizations may seem like parodies, but as any educator knows, that is the nature of unexamined assumptions that have been left to molder.\n\nOur hope is that the lesson plans here will not only teach how to use the Grand Tour Explorer with a variety of tools but also structure conversations about the nature of digital history. There is no substitute for direct experience of navigating premodern data. To this end, we have sought to flatten barriers to entry. The following practicums do not require any prior knowledge of coding or installation of tools. The only prerequisite is access to the Explorer, Google Sheets, and an internet connection. Slowly, but surely, readers practice many of the basic principles and best practices of data manipulation and visualization. We seek to level the playing field for both dyed-in-the-wool coders and self-described novices.\n\nWhile there is no substitute for learning by doing, I will briefly address three overarching themes here: the first is the value of starting with questions and quickly flipping them to consider the validity of the hypotheses they represent or inspire. The second is the merit of teaching researchers digital approaches to historical sources. The third is the importance of historicizing approaches to data. I see the third category as providing some of the most important lessons that students will take from the classroom into their daily lives.\n\nOver the course of the 2018&ndash;19 school year, I collaborated with Giovanna Ceserani to design and teach a course at Stanford University in tandem with the development of the Grand Tour Explorer. In this iteration of &ldquo;Virtual Italy: Methods for Historical Data Science,&rdquo; at that time called &ldquo;Mapping the Grand Tour: Digital Methods for Historical Data,&rdquo; each week focused on an essential question, such as &ldquo;Who were the Grand Tourists?,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why did tourists travel?&rdquo; These open-ended questions allowed us to move fluidly between traditional source analysis and the Grand Tour Explorer&rsquo;s database of thousands of British travelers. We modeled for students that being a historian meant having a full toolbelt of approaches. This included finding and reading primary sources but also selecting a program or metric that could produce the most useful quantitative or visual analysis.\n\nScholars are skilled artisans: it can be difficult to spot the cracks and absences in the literature. Our question-based approach meant that students quickly learned to see holes in the historiography. We deliberately chose many questions that scholars had long declared &ldquo;settled.&rdquo; It was only in attempting to recreate the results using different sources (hypothesis testing) that students began to see different results and to wonder why that was the case. Was it true that &ldquo;tourists travelled as rapidly as possible between major cities&rdquo; (Black 2003, 3)? If you mapped the data from the Explorer, you would indeed see very little representation of the countryside. Looking at the chronology of travels instead (practicum 5) revealed the weak plaster. This was our entry point for discussions about the nature of sources, which were more likely to record a date in general terms than to the day (&ldquo;a few hours,&rdquo; or &ldquo;some months back&rdquo;), and more likely to explicitly name a destination city than a humble way station. It was also the start of discussions about the compounding impact of data interpretation. &ldquo;Rome&rdquo; might be easy to match to coordinates and stick on a spreadsheet and map, but what about day trips or time &ldquo;in the country&rdquo; or &ldquo;on the road&rdquo;? If we &ldquo;cleaned up&rdquo; this messiness, how did it change our overall vision, and who would no longer be a part of the picture?\n\nTiming is also tricky in other ways. The truth is that in a single semester or ten-week quarter, students are unlikely to arrive at radical new answers. Historians often spend years in the exploratory stages of research before attempting publication. But the research paper as a genre can still teach students that the right stance is a definitive statement. The paper, duly argued and submitted, is then swiftly forgotten. Our goal for <em>Mapping the Grand Tour</em> was an approach in keeping with a history &ldquo;lab.&rdquo; Students knew from the beginning that they would be a part of an ongoing project with its own quirks. Platform outages at inopportune moments may have kept us up at night, but they vividly illustrated that history, too, is always &ldquo;under construction.&rdquo; Our hope was that students might be empowered, in turn, to make their own contributions and corrections.\n\nTake this as a warning: the result is often frustration&mdash;at least, at first. What seems remarkably smooth in the classroom (outages and all) can seem insurmountable when revisited at home, especially when applied in entirely self-directed inquiries. I met with our students after they submitted their proposals for independent research. I found that they had learned to ask the big questions but were stymied by what felt like the impossibility of answering them. Assurances that final projects would be exploratory provided only a modicum of comfort. Fired up by the possibilities, however, students wanted to accomplish all or nothing.\n\nI am a firm believer that any coursework should lead to independent practice, but moving from the structured to unstructured application is a significant hurdle. This, to me, is one of the most valuable lessons we can teach: how to grapple with limitations. Meeting individually with students is the invisible labor of these lesson plans. Students will need a capable <em>cicerone</em> helping them to break down big questions into small steps: if you don&rsquo;t have the information you need, how can you get it? What might serve as a proxy, or how can you integrate another source, or tool? How much time will it take you to do so, and is that feasible given your life? We have written these lesson plans with many such pauses, where we encourage you to pull back the curtain whenever possible, being clear about not just <em>what</em> you are doing but <em>why</em>.\n\nIt is important to make the invisible labor visible for students, both so that they can accomplish their goals and so that they can value what scholars spend the bulk of their time doing. Yes, their decisions and priorities will impact the work they produce, much as it has for thousands before them. This is the constant thread that ties together history and the present age: humans can be data, but data is invariably human.\n\n# Opening Up the World: Teaching Data-Intensive History with OpenData\n\n<span style=\"color: #AA8C00; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1; cursor: pointer\">Annie. K. Lamar</span>\n\nIn 2014, a group of researchers introduced what is now one of the largest consortiums of ancient open-data practitioners, curators, and developers. In their introduction, they write, &ldquo;Freeing datasets from their tools is another crucial step for re-use as well as sustainability.&rdquo;[^1] The Grand Tour Explorer is a prime example of what it means to free a dataset. By turning a large, inaccessible reference text into an expert-curated, searchable, open-access database, the Grand Tour Project team has not only freed data from its source, but also unlocked this data for researchers, scholars, and students.\n\nThe advantages of a large, curated, transdisciplinary, open-access dataset are numerous. As an interdisciplinary scholar whose research focuses on using machine-learning methods to promote and understand ancient languages, I strive to instill the values of open research in my students and my own work. When I taught the course &ldquo;Virtual Italy: Methods for Historical Data Science,&rdquo; I was a PhD candidate at Stanford splitting my time between the Data Science and Classics departments, and concurrently completing an MA in Education. Issues of data sustainability and pedagogy were at the forefront of mind at that moment.\n\nIn this brief reflection, I focus on the advantages specific to the Grand Tour Explorer and its data, rather than the overall benefits of normalizing the production of open-access data, which include bolstering democratic ideals through the educational and political empowerment of individuals, stimulating scientific discovery and innovation, and driving forward a global initiative to confront climate change and promote climate justice (to name a few). The Grand Tour Explorer, by the context of its subject, the intentionality of its design, and the presentation of its content exemplifies how powerful open-access data can be in education.\n\nAs a teacher for &ldquo;Virtual Italy: Methods for Historical Data Science,&rdquo; it was apparent that the project&rsquo;s dataset provides a rich foundation for personalized education. When students are interested in what they study, they are more motivated, confident, and involved in the class. The Grand Tour Explorer provides a varied context from which students can choose to pursue the ancient past by exploring the ancient Mediterranean monuments and places the travelers went to see, the recent past by examining patterns of the travelers, the present moment by asking what socio-cultural patterns have persisted from the Grand Tourists to our society, or the future by thinking about what parallel cultural fascinations and movements might exist in relation to our world. Students can also dive into questions about labor, politics, religion, race, socio-economic status, gender, and all the intersections between. The sheer amount of expert-curated metadata in the Grand Tour Explorer makes it a starting point for a research project in nearly any discipline.\n\nThe Grand Tour courses we taught consisted of first-year students and students about to graduate. We had students with advanced levels of programming, and students who had to be taught how to right-click. Students with all levels of academic and technical experience were able to form high-quality research questions that they found compelling, and use the available data to address these questions. I did in fact teach one of my students how to right-click. That student was able to find a research question so personally compelling that by the end of the course, they were learning Python and eventually landed a role as a digital humanities intern. The power of curated, diverse, and open-access data can be immensely transformative in students&rsquo; academic careers because of the opportunities it provides.\n\nAt the same time this dataset offers opportunities for individually-designed learning experiences, it also fosters an excellent environment for collaboration. The framing of the course attracts students from a wide variety of disciplines, and the intersectional content of the data invites students to seek out others with knowledge bases different than their own. Furthermore, the project-based character of the course means that students need to develop not only technical skills, but also academic and meta-cognitive skills to succeed. Teams of students with different strengths naturally form in a classroom environment that rewards collaboration, encourages academic risk-taking, and demands questioning.\n\nRachel Midura already summarized well the value of learning through inquiry and how digital methods promote such learning. I&rsquo;ll only comment further to emphasize that the Grand Tour Explorer itself is designed to promote varied and original inquiry. The search engine allows learners to add and remove filters from numerous categories, to search across all text-based fields, and to view travelers both individually and in relational contexts. The advanced search page presents categories equally as important, allowing the learner space to formulate their own ideas about what avenues of inquiry they might pursue.\n\nOn a final note, it was an incredible boon that this data was available for teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. I taught &ldquo;Virtual Italy: Methods for Historical Data Science&rdquo; alongside Giovanna Ceserani during the summer quarter of 2021, when Stanford University was still largely virtual, and during the fall quarter of 2021 as Stanford transitioned back into in-person classrooms. During the pandemic, it was not possible for our students to participate in many of the activities that are generally available to history classes; in particular, the library archives were closed. Archival research is a powerful way to help students connect with specific people and their lived experiences, and we are fortunate that Stanford Library has several travel manuscripts and journals.\n\nThe Grand Tour Explorer allowed us to simulate an archival experience because so much care was put into the presentation of individual Grand Tourists. Students connected with people&rsquo;s past experiences by reading carefully transcribed and formatted descriptions of their travels, which often feature quotes, mentions of other people in the database, and personal details. Even in a (relatively) post-COVID world, many students and institutions do not have access to archives to enable this unique type of learning. Databases like the Grand Tour Explorer give millions of students the chance to engage in archival-like, micro-history-informed research by practicing open science and embracing open data.\n\n# Notes\n\n[^1]: Rainer Simon, Elton Barker, Pau de Soto, and Leif Isaksen, &ldquo;Pelagios,&rdquo; *Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) Papers* 7, no. 27 (2014).\n\n\n\n\n"

Some years ago, I published a book that concentrated upon British experiences and representations of Italian cities during the long eighteenth century, Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c. 1690-1820.1 As an urban historian, I was less concerned with what was collected or purchased by travelers, or with their social networks, than with exploring how images of major Italian cities were constructed and considering their influence in British culture. Given the opportunity to work with the Grand Tour Explorer, I wanted to use it to pursue several questions.</p>\n\nLike many historians, years of immersion in the primary sources meant that I had an intuitive sense of evolving patterns of travel and the composition of the traveling body. However, I was unable to provide any rigorous quantifiable basis for my conclusions or generalizations. How far were my generalizations borne out by the evidence of the Explorer, while taking into account the complex nature of its data, which we know to be far from complete (see the introduction of the book)? What new light could the Explorer cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the Explorer tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body? The dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste, acquired and polished in Italy, exercised such a powerful influence upon Britain’s eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.2 But it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic grand tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out throughout my book was the increasing presence of both female travelers and travelers from beyond the landed elite over the course of the eighteenth century, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book: Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile: such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa and Leghorn.\n"
