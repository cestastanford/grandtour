Renaldi was a British painter of Italian parentage who had trained and exhibited in London. He had also stayed with Jones in Naples for three months in 1781 and would later spend ten years working as a painter in Bengal, before returning to Britain and painting this and other portraits of the Jones family.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Jones, Marchi and Renaldi were friends, and part of a network of painters with connections to the British Grand Tour in Italy. While Marchi (and even Renaldi, who was born in Britain) escaped the focused attention of the compiler of <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em> (compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells, 1997), <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4067\" target=\"\\_blank\">Reynolds</a>’ and Jones’ entries provide at least some mention of these two Anglo-Italian artists from which one can build a sharper picture of the interconnectedness and movement within the <em>Explorer</em>. These portraits of Thomas Jones frame a life which began and ended in Wales, but they hide the hybrid origins and cultural identities of this trio of painters, as well as the nature and depth of their lived experiences in Italy and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>On 11 March 1783, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jones</a> wrote: “I had been now for some time infected with the <em>Swiss Malady</em> and longed to see my Native Country once more.”<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>  After three years in Naples, Jones had had enough of his Italian experience and wanted to go home. He had failed to get enough commissions or find a powerful enough patron, British or Italian.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> Only a few weeks later, in early April 1783, did <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2219\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Hamilton</a> and his family by Francesco Renaldi (1755-c.1790) (1730-1803, travel years 1764-1800) the British emissary and chief “fixer” in Naples, finally agree to buy a large prospective view of the Campi Phlegrei (now lost) which Jones had almost finished.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> It was “too little, too late,” as Jones was determined to return to Britain with his family—his wife, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Maria Moncke</a>, a Danish woman who had been his housekeeper in Rome, and their two daughters (<a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715.2\" target=\"\\_blank\">Anna Maria</a>, b. 1780, travel years 1780-1783; and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715.3\" target=\"\\_blank\">Elizabeth Francesca</a>, b. 1781, travel years 1781-1783)—and they left for Britain a few months later in August 1783.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> The portrait of Jones’ family by Renaldi, painted after their return to Wales, shows the settled appearance of a prosperous Welsh landowner, belying Jones’ seven-year residency in Italy. Jones balances a palette, paintbrush, and painter’s mahlstick on one arm; there is a folder of prints in front of him and an unfinished landscape on an easel behind him. He looks away from his wife and daughters who are portrayed as models of provincial propriety and accomplishment (a self-portrait of Renaldi peers over the scene from the center of the canvas). Jones never returned to Italy; by the time of this portrait, his professional career as a painter was finished and he would devote the final years of his life to running his family’s estate, writing in 1798 that his life had become “with little interruptions, one uniform scene of domestick Retirement—at times, indeed, amusing myself with my beloved Art”, painting for his own amusement.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>For three years, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a> had lived at the center of one of the cultural capitals of Europe—attending the opera, taking day trips to Sorrento by boat, befriending Italian painters, and buying fresh peas from street vendors. His Neapolitan life can be found in the many sources that he left behind—his paintings of the city, his “Memoirs” cited above (based on a diary that he kept at the time at his side, now lost) and a full set of household accounts.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> None of this material is new; art historians, in particular, have used the “Memoirs” and accounts in their analysis of his paintings but few have analyzed these sources, both written and painted, together, as careful and evocative observations of urban life. His visual representations of Naples as a city, especially its buildings and urban spaces, are unique for this period and also for what looks like their abstraction and the absence of any people. Jones’ paintings of the city’s rooftops and spaces conform neither to the contemporary taste for ethnographic representations of Neapolitan street culture, made popular by painters such as Pietro Fabris, nor for the panoramic views of the city by his friend Giovanni Battista Lusieri.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> All of Jones’ Neapolitan cityscapes were painted on paper, suggesting that, like his diary entries, they were his private visual musings and not meant for sale or display to Grand Tourists.</p>\n\n<p>These textual and visual sources evoke urban experience on the Grand Tour—the sounds of streets, the surfaces of buildings, the light hitting canvas awnings. This attention to (sensory) detail in relation to the urban experience of visitors to Italian cities is not easily replicated in the entries of Ingamells’ <em>Dictionary</em>, or in their digital transformation in the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em>. Using the “free-search” function in the <em>Explorer</em> for words relating to the sensory and spatial experience of urban life—such as “smoke,” “noise,” “crowd,” “carriage,” “cart,” “stall,” or “porter”—leads to just a few faint traces. For example, bells appear in an anecdote about <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/587\" target=\"\\_blank\">Frederick Augustus Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol</a>’s (1730-1803, travel years 1765-1766, 1770-1772, 1777-1779, 1785-1786, 1789-1790, 1794-1803), aversion to them as a religious procession passed by his hotel in Siena, which the <em>Dictionary</em>, and hence the <em>Explorer</em>, record from an early nineteenth-century memoir.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup>  While Jones’ account of the “Chaos of Noises filth and Confusion” around his first apartment in Naples is cited from the “Memoirs,” in the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entry and the <em>Explorer</em>, the reasons for the chaos or his concern about putting off prospective clients are not.<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a>’ tour and, in particular, his residence in Naples, as a starting point, this essay seeks to illuminate cases in which the British experience of Italian cities was sustained and engaged, when tourists engaged more deeply with their Italian counterparts and when their stays stretched longer—for some, in fact, becoming life-long. Close consideration of Jones’ paintings and accounts provides clues to guide a “distant reading” through the <em>Explorer</em>. Could the digital transformation operated by the <em>Explorer</em> allow us to glean more of the Italian presence from the <em>Dictionary</em>’s pages? Seeking to grasp the elusive sensory experience of eighteenth-century travelers, could the interpersonal and the temporal dimensions of travel which the <em>Explorer</em> offers help us better color our vision of the British Grand Tour?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Representing Naples in the paintings and words of Thomas Jones</strong></p>\n\n<p>On his visit to Naples, the German painter Jacob Philipp Hackert complimented <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a>, recognizing their affinity as painters who paid “due attention to the <em>Detail</em>—that is to say, minute finishing.”<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> It was this exactness of detail which led to the rediscovery of Jones’ work in the mid-20th century; but it was also this exactness which comes through in his “Memoirs,” as he evokes the sounds and smells of the streets of Italian cities in words. His eye and ear for these details are apparent from the beginning of his tour to Italy, as he passes through different cities, making observations along the way, perhaps distinguishing himself from other Grand Tourists who pay no heed to what happens outside of their carriages. For instance, a walk early in the morning brings an observation about the different ways that porters carry their goods in Turin and Milan. Jones then continues, “It being cold foggy weather, all the men were muffled up to their noses in cloaks, or loose great Coats, with the Sleeves hanging down according to the Italian custom, and Smoking out of curved wooden pipes, the bowls of which only appeared.”<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup> This level of evocative detail extends to descriptions of other environments in which the senses dominate. In Rome, his breath “stop’d” as he entered a room full of smoking Scandinavians and Slavs in Rome,<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> and, in the heat of late September, he recalls, “I was kept in a gentle perspiration, sitting in my Shirt &amp; thin linnen Drawers without Stockens - with the Windows open - and in this dress I sat down to paint.”<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> He recounts a night at the opera in Naples with <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3908\" target=\"\\_blank\">Giuseppe Plura</a> (b. 1753, travel years 1778-1881), which he had to abandon “as the noise was so great that we could not hear the Performers, and the dazzling Glare of the Candles &amp; looking-glasses made me quite giddy.”<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup> His descriptions are not so much an indication of his eye and ear for ethnographic detail but instead show his sensitivity to the senses, of light, sound, and smell.</p>\n\n<p>His paintings of the city are the visual equivalent of these sensory descriptions—the light hitting the pitted surface of walls, the dark cavities of building interiors. These descriptions and paintings establish <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a> as an evocative witness to urban life.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-3.png\" id=\"fig3\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap3\">\n\n<b>Fig. 3:</b> Thomas Jones, <i>Buildings in Naples</i>, 1782.

Like many Grand Tourists, he literally carried ideas about Italians in his jacket pocket as he travelled, but these guidebooks were soon put to the test by his actual interactions with people. Not long after arriving in Rome, he seemed genuinely surprised not to be knifed after a night of conversation with “three sprightly girls,” the daughters of an innkeeper near Frascati. He wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>We were joined by a Couple of young Fellows muffled up to the nose in their long cloaks - I had been so prepossessed, by books, with frightful ideas of Italian jealousy and Italian revenge, that I sat in Agony for the Consequence, nor could my Companions reasoning or ridicule entirely divert me of it - However we at length cheerfully sat down to supper - and soon after went to bed and slept soundly, devoid of Care.<span><sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>By 1779, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a> knew Italian well enough to write love-letters for his friend, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3749\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Pars</a> (1742-1782, travel years 1775-1782), with pleasing results; “the favourable reception and the kind answers” that Pars received to these “Amorous Epistles” was testimony to Jones’ skill in written Italian.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup> From Naples in 1782, Jones remarked that he had not seen an English newspaper since leaving Rome two years earlier.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup> His immersion is also witnessed in the account book in which he recorded his expenses in Naples, shifting suddenly from English to Italian on the day after he slept in his apartment in front of the Dogana del Sale (depicted in <a href=\"#figure-3\">Figure 3</a>), just days after arriving in the city.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> The depth of Jones’ immersion in Naples distinguishes him from many British Grand Tourists. As he had promised himself after his first unsuccessful meeting with <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2219\" target=\"\\_blank\">Hamilton</a> in May 1780, he avoided the company of English tourists as much as he could and, instead, kept company with Italians, with whom he claims to have kept up a correspondence years after he left Italy (although none of it survives).<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup> Within months of Renaldi’s arrival in Naples in July 1781, he had introduced Jones to the Italian painters Giuseppe Bonito and Luigi Micheli; in turn, Micheli lived on the same street as Giambattista Lusieri who also became a friend of Jones.<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> Micheli and Lusieri appear respectively as Don Luigi and Don Titta in Jones’ “Memoirs”. (Lusieri also appears in four other entries in the <em>Explorer</em> by this nickname, transcribed variously as Don Titta, Don Teta, and Don Tito).<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup> Jones’ relationship with these Italian artists is part of a larger web of interconnections that extends well beyond the bounds of the <em>Explorer</em> to include, for instance, overlapping circles of friendship and acquaintance with French artists in Naples such as Pierre-Jacques Volaire.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> These are relationships of varying intensities with non-British artists whose works surfaced in British country house collections—relationships which begin to come into view also through the <em>Explorer</em> as visualized in <a href=\"#figure-4\">Figure 4</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-4.png\" id=\"fig4\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap4&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\n<b>Fig. 4:</b> Thomas Jones in relation to the mentioned names in his entry text, as parsed by the <i>Explorer</i>. Names in italics do not have their own entries, suggest a much wider network of non-British relationships. The figure also distinguishes in maroon the relationships that originated or flourished in Naples, indicating the depth of Jones’ involvement in this city’s social life.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>This brief analysis of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a>’ paintings and “Memoirs” show the extent to which both are witness to his Neapolitan life.  Jones lived in three residences across the city—the first near the Dogana di Sale which kept him close to the clamor of the warehouses and port, the second near Capodimonte which kept him close to his new Italian artist friends, Lusieri and Micheli, and the third, behind Chiaia, which brought him closer to the “court side” of town and represented a final attempt to find the Grand Tourist patrons that he so desired. His evocation of urban life in Naples illustrates how he could escape the rhetorical and visual tropes of British representations of Italy. When he was writing his “Memoirs,” which he finished fifteen years after his return to Britain in 1798, he reflected on his delight, early during his time in Italy, that he was so “familiarized with, &amp; enamoured of Italian forms,” having copied Italian landscapes under the tutelage of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/5165\" target=\"\\_blank\">Richard Wilson</a> in London in the 1760s (1713-1782, travel years 1750-1756/7).<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> However, Jones’ cityscapes show his willingness to look elsewhere for inspiration. In this way, he was able to develop his own unique visual style, which recorded the light, space, and textures which surrounded him in the city of Naples.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a>’ life and work also reveal the value of British artists as historical informants and the ways in which we can find Italian and British experience of Italy in the extraordinary wealth of material which came out of the eighteenth-century Grand Tour. Can the <em>Explorer</em> allow researchers to develop and build more histories of these connections, engagements, and exchanges with Italy and Italians, while engaging with the qualitative analyses of the many (and often familiar) sources produced by the Grand Tour?</p>\n\n<p><strong>(Word-)Searching for Italians</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jones</a> claimed that Romans divided British travelers into three classes: <em>Artisti</em> (“here, as well for Study and Improvement, as emolument by their profession”), <em>Mezzi-Cavalieri</em> (“who lived genteely, independent of any profession, [and] kept a servant”), and the true <em>Cavalieri</em> or <em>Milordi Inglesi</em> (“those who moved in a Circle of Superior Splendour”).<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> Jones himself was uncertain about his own place within these first two categories and his life story justifies that ambivalence.<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> What is not included in his characterization is a fourth cross-over class of British residents who lived and worked in Italian cities—diplomats, merchants, and men who served the Grand Tour industry or those who might have come to Italy as artists or gentlemen but then set up a household in Italy, becoming longer-term residents. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2219\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Hamilton</a>, the British emissary to Naples, is perhaps the best known of longer term residents, living in the city more or less continuously, with some brief breaks in England and other parts of Italy between 1764 and 1800; his enduring presence and power in the city and at the Bourbon court makes him a particularly important node from which to study the British community in Naples, and in particular Grand Tourists. There were also British merchants with long-standing relationships to the city for which further archival research in the Italian archives would be necessary in order to go beyond the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> (curiously, there is <em>another</em> <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2218\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Hamilton</a> (travel years 1753-1757), “the oldest and most Eminent Merchant” in the city of Naples, who appears twice in the records, once in 1753 and again in 1757).<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup> The British <em>ciceroni</em> who served the tourist industry were important intermediaries between the British community and Italians and, by necessity, had specific knowledge of Italian cities to offer to their clients, as Carole Paul’s essay on <em>ciceroni</em> demonstrates. These distinctions between Grand Tourists and longer-term residents necessarily reveal that cities could be lived in as more than simply places of amusement, education, or exploitation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a>’ “Memoirs” indicate a variety of important relationships formed not just with other long-term British residents, but also with Italians. During his professional travails, he wrote, desolately, “Looking upon my self as deserted by my Countrymen—the depression of my Spirits was such, that I endeavored avoiding as much as possible those places where I was most likely to meet them.”<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup>  As noted above, Jones was determined to make friends with some local Italian artists, friendships which endured beyond his return to Wales three years later. Yet these Italian men—and Italian women, as Catherine Sama’s essay on Rosalba Carriera shows—are largely absent from Grand Tour scholarship as a whole.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>As its title indicates, the <em>Dictionary</em> did not include in its entries the constellation of Italians involved in the Grand Tour. There are, however, brief biographical notes at the back of Ingamells’ book dedicated to “select foreign artists, antiquaries, and diplomats…whose names recur in the <em>Dictionary</em>.” Two-thirds of these supplementary characters are identified as Italian (41 out of a total of 62); of these, the majority are artists long dead before the eighteenth century, which highlights the antiquarian and artistic interests of the Grand Tour as filtered through the hands of Brinsley Ford and Ingamells.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> The <em>Dictionary</em> takes an idiosyncratic approach to a number of Anglo-Italians: it grants no entries, for example, to Marchi or Renaldi, who had painted <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jones</a> and his family before and after his time in Italy, nor do these two artists appear in the supplementary biographies at the back of Ingamells. In contrast, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3908\" target=\"\\_blank\">Giuseppe (or Joseph) Plura</a> (b. 1753, travel years 1778-1881), the son of a Turinese sculptor who had settled in Bath, and a traveling companion for Jones on his first trip to Naples, is included among the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entries.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> This difficulty of “fixing” as either British or Italian the hybrid nature of family lives and career trajectories which crossed Britain and Italy is clear, for example, in the case of the musical performers <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4569\" target=\"\\_blank\">Anna Storace</a> (1766-1817, travel years 1778-1784, c. 1787-c. 1801), and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4570\" target=\"\\_blank\">Stephen Storace</a> (1763-1796, travel years c. 1775-1781), both of whom were born and died in Britain but whose professional life was only recorded by Grand Tourists when they were in Italy.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Dictionary</em>’s pages are peppered with mentions of Italian names and an advantage of the digital <em>Explorer</em> is that it allows us to find many of these Italians who did not merit individual recognition in the original print text. Using the “free-search” function, one can produce a number of matching entries for a more comprehensive review “by hand,” and the <em>Explorer</em>’s mentioned names permit a more systematic search for Italian presence as well. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a> provides a good example: the graph visualizing the names mentioned in his entry is comprised a third of individuals, mostly Italians and other foreigners, who do not have entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>, drawing in a wider field of names and connections to our study of Jones’ life in Italy (<a href=\"#figure-4\">Figure 4</a>).</p>\n\n<p>However, many Italians appearing in the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entries are artists, and their mention only relates to specific works of architecture or art which Grand Tourists had seen or were buying (“Palladio,” “Guercino,” “Battoni”). Ingamells’ <em>Dictionary</em> must have been an important starting point for Ilaria Bignamini and Clare Hornsby’s reconstruction of the antiquities market in 18th-century Rome in which there were many Italians engaged daily with British agents such as <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2207\" target=\"\\_blank\">Gavin Hamilton</a> (1723-1798, travel years 1748-1750, 1756-1798), <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2680\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jenkins</a> (1722-1798, travel years 1751-1798), and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1652\" target=\"\\_blank\">Robert Fagan</a> (1761-1816, travel years 1781-1782, 1784-1814, c. 1815-1816), but who remain to be studied.<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup> Many other entries make mention of British painters and architects both known, such as Carlo Fontana, and unknown, such as “Signor Abramo Paris,” teachers of the Scottish architect <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1937\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Gibb</a> (1682-1754, travel years -1703-1708).</p>\n\n<p>In fact, if one searches for “Signor” in the entries, a number of Italians do come up (along with some British travelers such as <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2283\" target=\"\\_blank\">Johanna Hart</a> (travel years -1756-1757), who appears as  “Signora Giovanna Harz” in the citation of a primary source).<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> In many cases, these Italians are difficult or impossible to trace without further archival research. For example, “Signor Giacomo” was paid for some architectural plans and for teaching <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1032\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Coke of Holkham</a> (1697-1759, travel years 1713-1717). Less well-known artists, copyists and modelers who served the Grand Tour community also turn up in a search under “Signor”: for example, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1179\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Craster</a> (1735-1772, travel years 1761-1762), an army officer from Craster, Northumbria, commissioned two portraits by Batoni and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1288\" target=\"\\_blank\">Nathaniel Dance</a> (1735-1811, travel years 1754-1766), but he also commissioned “copies in miniature by signora Tibaldi.”<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup> Agents such as those in Rome also met the collecting needs of British tourists in other Italian cities, such as Signor Magnolfi, the Florentine agent for the antiquary <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4678\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Talman</a> (1677-1726, travel years 1699-1702, 1709-1717, 1719, 1721, 1723). More <em>signori</em> appear as part of the Grand Tour “service” community including guides and companions such as “Signor Armano of Bologna” who accompanied <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2445\" target=\"\\_blank\">Richard Colte Hoare</a> (1758-1838, travel years 1785-1787, 1788-1791), for the voyage from Tuscany to Rome or Signora Minerbetti, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3169\" target=\"\\_blank\">Horace Mann</a>’s <em>cicisbea</em>, who presented <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1508.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lady Mary Tufton</a> (1723-1806, travel years 1773-1778)—the wife of the Scottish aristocrat <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1508\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Duncan</a> (c. 1715-1774, travel years 1773-1774)—to the Grand Duke of Florence.<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Encounters with Italian <em>signori</em>, however, do not always imply some sort of transcultural understanding or exchange with British travelers. We know that guidebooks framed the responses of British travelers to Italian life, carrying with them characterizations of Italy inherited from anti-Catholic rhetoric developed since the Reformation (and compounded by ancient climatic theories revived by Montesquieu and others in the eighteenth century).<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup> We also know that the British traveling community often stuck together, socializing and traveling in groups and using the same service networks. As <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3319\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Mildmay</a> (c. 1705-1771, travel years 1730-1) suggests in his description upon arriving in Livorno in 1730, many British travelers and residents lived in close-knit English-speaking communities; he writes that “there are computed to be about 43 English families at present &amp; our language is as frequently heard in the streets &amp; coffee houses, as the Italian itself.” These communities were well-served: <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3793\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Pelham</a> (1756-1826, travel years 1777, 1792-1793), for instance, was thrilled to have found in Florence a Signor Molini who “will sell me all kind of English things … from Birmingham,” and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2759\" target=\"\\_blank\">David Ker</a> (1742-1811, travel years 1792-1794), an Irishman, boasted that he had made “an Italian servant we had at Florence [into] a very good English Cook.” Food was a particular concern for Grand Tourists, many of them overcome by a longing for roast beef and disdain for French sauces as soon as they left the shores of England.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup> Italian food seems to have fared better in diaries and travel accounts, although Grand Tourists were always looking for a good roast. After three months in Italy, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a> notes that he and his companion “were both heartily sick of the Italian Soups &amp; Stews…and were obliged to be our own cooks”; his friends were “very glad to sit down to a piece of Roast Beef and Plumb pudding.”<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup> Later, in his memoirs, however, we can see Jones adapting to a new culinary regime. In the final months of his stay in Italy, Jones recorded a visit to “a large Manufactory of Maccaroni” on the outskirts of Naples, near Torre Annunziata (where the manufacturing of <em>pastasciutta</em> continues today), and he bought twenty-four pounds of macaroni as part of his food supplies for his family’s trip home to England by sea in August 1783.<sup id=\"fnref:40\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></sup> While Grand Tourists were more often longing for English food while away from home, this taste for Italian food in England was not unusual; a number of them wanted to recreate these new tastes and flavors, shipping home Chianti wine and Parmesan cheese, and, after their return, buying more Italian food from fashionable grocers in London.<sup id=\"fnref:41\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></sup> Jones’ reliance on such a large amount of macaroni as a foodstuff for his trip home to England confirms the depth of his and his family’s alimentary acculturation during his long residency in the city.<sup id=\"fnref:42\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Travel to Italy, at least dating from the Renaissance, was meant to be educational, and in the eighteenth century, the Grand Tour had not yet lost its didactic function. Travelers not only acquired wheels of Parmesan cheese and antique Roman objects to ship back to Britain but many were also keen to gain some knowledge of the modern Italian language.<sup id=\"fnref:43\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></sup> Grammar books were produced specifically for this purpose,<sup id=\"fnref:44\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></sup> and a number of <em>signori</em> in the <em>Explorer</em> provided instruction in Italian. When the antiquarian <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4040\" target=\"\\_blank\">Richard Rawlinson</a> (1690-1755, travel years 1720-1726) returned to Rome in the autumn of 1721, he “learned that his language master had died but within four days he had [found] another, ‘Signore de la Mothe’.” In Rome, in the summer of 1777, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3793\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Pelham</a> spent his mornings “employed in learning Italian &amp; the History of Italy” and when he was in Florence in the autumn, he hired his father’s former Italian language teacher, the Abbé Pellori. There were, of course, Italians who could speak English and entertain and keep the British travelers company. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jones</a> noted with pleasure that, after a day’s sight-seeing during a short stay in Bologna, on his way down to Rome he had “met Dr Geraldi who spoke good English at the Cof-House.”<sup id=\"fnref:45\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></sup> One British resident in Florence wrote that since <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/5044\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Weddell</a> (1736-1792, travel years 1764-1765) and his companion spoke no Italian or French and “the Society of the Inhabitants here did not give them much pleasure, they chose to spend their evenings with ‘Signor Cassali’.”<sup id=\"fnref:46\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>As these examples suggest, British travelers did indeed form relationships with Italian <em>signori</em>. Some of them were strictly financial, as this short but enigmatic entry for <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2980\" target=\"\\_blank\">Isabella Littlejohn</a> (travel year 1790) suggests: “<a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Byres</a> borrowed money from Isabella Littlejohn (Signora Francesco Tribuzzi) in 1790.” For many travelers, their primary and daily contact with Italians was as their tenants or guests, such as the portrait painter <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2728\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Keeble</a> (or Keable) (1714-1774, travel years 1761-1774) who “lived in the house of Domenico Gandolfi” when he was in Bologna. There were also professional relationships. The Irish painter <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/265\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Barry</a> (1741-1806, travel years 1766-1771) attributed his election to the Accademia Clementina “to the obliging dispositions of two friends of mine here, Mr Keable and Signor Bianconi.” Castruccio Bonamici commissioned the same Keeble to paint his portrait in Naples.<sup id=\"fnref:47\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></sup> Some of these financial arrangements also betray sentimental relationships—such as the annuity left in the will of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/521\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Bouverie</a> (c. 1722-1750, travel years 1741-1742, 1745-1746, 1749-1750) to “Signora Teresa Tacconio of Bologna.” As Jeremy Black has reiterated, the Grand Tour also provided opportunities for sexual experimentation and social transgression for British travelers away from home.<sup id=\"fnref:48\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:48\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></sup> For example, the Third Earl of Peterborough, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3832\" target=\"\\_blank\">Charles Mordaunt</a> (1658-1735, travel years 1706-1707, 1711-1712, 1714, 1715, 1716-1718, 1719-1720) was known to stay in Bologna, “where he has been many times,” for private reasons “regarding his engagement to Signora Catina.” Many of these characters—from Signor Giacomo to Signora Catina—remain unknown and the unevenness of Ingamells’ use of biographical data in the <em>Dictionary</em> means that these sorts of relationships are sometimes difficult to quantify across the <em>Explorer</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to gauge British engagement with Italian society would be to examine the number of “travelers” who married Italians. In most cases, this implies a reconsideration of terms such as Grand Tourists and travelers (which Ingamells implicitly did by including British residents in his <em>Dictionary</em>). Further archival research in cities such as Livorno where there had been a continuous presence of British merchants since the early modern period would be one way forward, as Simon Macdonald’s new research on the British resident community in Paris has so fruitfully shown.<sup id=\"fnref:49\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:49\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></sup> More research could also be done on the importance of the resident British community which serviced travelers’ needs, their local knowledge commodified for this shifting group of Grand Tourists. In the <em>Explorer</em>, the information regarding marriage is found in the main headings of each entry, although there is not yet a separate category to search this information across entries (while one can of course do such a search within the downloaded dataset). A casual search found two Irish Catholics married to Italian women—the dealer <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1652\" target=\"\\_blank\">Robert Fagan</a>, who lived in Italy for thirty years and was married twice to young Italian women, and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2759\" target=\"\\_blank\">David Ker</a> (1742-1811, travel years 1792-1794), who spent two years in Italy with his three daughters after the death of his Venetian wife, Maddalena Guardi, in 1785.<sup id=\"fnref:50\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:50\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">50</a></sup> There is also the case of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/135\" target=\"\\_blank\">Eliza Ashburner</a> (travel years 1783-1800-), “a lady-in-waiting to one of the daughters of the Queen of Naples” who had married Signor Perconte (a <em>secretario refferendario del Regno</em>) in June 1800, presumably in the aftermath of the rushed retreat of the Bourbon court to Naples. A more focused word-search using Italian first-names found a number of Britons married to Italians—for example, the search for a common first-name, “Giovanna,” found <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2636\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Jackson</a> (1692-1763, travel years c. 1713-1763), described as a diplomat and merchant by Ingamells. Married to an Italian Catholic, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2636.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Mary Joanna Rimaldini</a>, Jackson lived most of his life in Livorno, fifty years in total, except for a two-year stint as the British consul in Genoa, and he died in Ancona, presumably while visiting <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2636.5\" target=\"\\_blank\">his daughter</a>.<sup id=\"fnref:51\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:51\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></sup>  Testimony to his rootedness in Italian society is that the Cardinal from which he received special dispensation to marry as a Protestant became Pope Benedict XIV and was the godfather of Jackson’s eldest son, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2636.2\" target=\"\\_blank\">Prospero</a>. George Jackson’s knowledge of Italian culture clearly went beyond polite conversation; Jackson gathered an enormous library of more than 3000 books and manuscripts in Italian and Latin for which he published a catalog in 1756.<sup id=\"fnref:52\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></sup> Jackson was buried in the English cemetery in Livorno and his tombstone still carries the spelling mistakes in English of the Italian stone mason who carved it.<sup id=\"fnref:53\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:53\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></sup> A search for the male equivalent, “Giovanni,” brings up the husband of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2677\" target=\"\\_blank\">Anna Maria Jenkins</a> (travel years 1788-1794-) who spent four years in Rome with her uncle, the antiquary <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2680\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jenkins</a>;<sup id=\"fnref:54\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:54\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">54</a></sup> Anna Maria married Giovanni Martinez, “the nephew of Thomas Jenkins’s neighbor on the Corso,” in 1794 but there is no further notice of her life in Italy or in England. Marriage to an Italian, of course, is not the only way to gauge the rootedness of British residents in Italy. The unmarried British Abbés and Monsignors who pop up throughout the <em>Dictionary</em> bely the significant number of British Catholics (including Stuart sympathizers) who made Rome their home over many years. Nonetheless, this directed and random word-searching has brought to light a number of Italians whose relationship with Britons went beyond buying art or social visits in aristocratic palaces. In turn, further research would need to be done to know more about British travelers who became residents, sometimes working for British Grand Tourists, occasionally marrying Italians, living out their lives in Italy, and sometimes dying there as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visualizing British experience in Italy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Might the rich travel data contained in the <em>Explorer</em> offer insights or ways to approach the question of British engagement with Italian urban life? In many ways, the <em>Explorer</em> confirms the well-worn narrative, with the largest number of travelers going to Rome (3384), followed by Florence (2154), Venice (2138), and Naples (1942). It is common knowledge that travel itineraries on the Grand Tour varied, some travelers completing their travels over a few months, others over a few years, most often with the intention of returning home to Britain. We also know that there were seasonal patterns to visits to particular cities—as Rosemary Sweet reminds us, travelers often went to Naples for Lent to get away from the boredom of Rome or, for shorter periods, to Venice for Carnival.<sup id=\"fnref:55\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:55\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">55</a></sup>  Grand Tour itineraries followed these seasonal ebbs and flows—for instance, the liquefaction of San Gennaro’s blood each year on 22 September was a must-see for many tourists, including <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jones</a> who managed to combine his first visit to Naples in September 1778 to time with the feast day of the city’s patron saint and an eruption of Vesuvius.<sup id=\"fnref:56\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:56\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">56</a></sup> The regular eruptions of Vesuvius in the eighteenth century brought visitors to Naples within days, as Goethe notes in his entry from 24 November 1787: “At the moment it seems as if all the art treasures of Rome were of no account; all the foreigners have interrupted their sightseeing tour and are hurrying off to Naples.”<sup id=\"fnref:57\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:57\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">57</a></sup> Further research could track the known eruptions of Vesuvius with the arrival dates of tourists using the <em>Explorer</em> as well as map the seasonal patterns of visitors to the city according to religious festivals—for example, Lent to Easter—or to the weather—for example, avoiding the intensity of the heat of the summer or enjoying the mild weather in the winter months in Naples.</p>\n\n<p>Yet popularity of “travel places” alone is only one possible approach, and complicated by the absences in the archive. First, there is the matter of the often absent details of the journey to and within Italy. We have to assume that most Grand Tourists in the database started their travels in Britain, arriving by land or sea from France, from further east by land, or sailing around Gibraltar. “Gateway” cities, searched as “travel places” in the <em>Explorer</em>, included Turin (949), Milan (590) and Bologna (671) on the way to Rome from France, or Leghorn (977, although 3 for Livorno) if arriving by sea to Florence, or smaller stops such as Terracina (13) on the way to Naples. While tourists must have stopped through many of these cities <em>en route</em>, they appear much less popular than the major destination cities (as “travel places”): this, of course, has to do with the fact that Grand Tourists did not always record their stays in their diaries and memoirs, or that they were not included by Ingamells and his collaborators, even though we know of the existence of inns which served these popular routes.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> allows us to take a different approach to the qualities of stays in cities, and, in turn, engagement with Italian life. Even within the biography of one traveler, there is variety in the length as well as the quality of visits. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jones</a> first stayed in Naples for just four months in 1778 but then he returned two years later and stayed for three years until 1783. The first visit in his memoirs records a typical Grand Tour itinerary with trips to the main sites in and around the city while his second is taken up by more mundane business of finding accommodation, moving furniture, and buying paints.<sup id=\"fnref:58\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:58\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">58</a></sup> Continuing to use Jones as our guide, we can look for “travelers” who stayed longer in any city and who might have engaged more substantially with Italian urban life.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that the absences in the archive continue to shape the possibilities and results of such an exploration. Data often remains incomplete for travelers who did not keep diaries as detailed as Jones’, or whose best records remain in Italian archives, unincorporated in the <em>Dictionary</em>. Some indicate approximate dates of stay or just a year, while others give exact dates of stays—compare, for instance, Jones’ “travels” with his friend <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Pars</a>’ in the <em>Explorer</em>, whose dates were partially reconstructed by using Jones’ “Memoirs”. All in all, about a quarter of travelers are recorded with enough detail to calculate their duration of stay (1450 of 6,007).<sup id=\"fnref:59\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:59\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">59</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-5.svg\" id=\"fig5\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap5&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap5\">\n\n<b>Fig. 5:</b> Number of trips to popular cities.

While Naples had only the fourth largest number of visitors, the average length of stay in the city (43 days) was nearly as long as that in Rome (50.5) and far longer than all other popular cities.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"#figure-7\">Figure 7</a> shows the division of travelers by occupation, but indicates the difficulty of data absence in many categories. While diplomats, merchants, painters, and statesmen represent some of the most numerous groups, there are still significant limitations to the dating of their travels. The long residencies of men such as <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2636\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Jackson</a> as a merchant in Livorno stand out immediately—in fact, only three merchants have precise enough dating to be included within the subset, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/612\" target=\"\\_blank\">N. Brooke</a> (travel years 1786-1797), <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/916\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Chetham</a> (1678-1701, travel years 1700-1701), and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2238\" target=\"\\_blank\">Christopher Hanbury</a> (c. 1661-1716, travel years -1704-1716). We know anecdotally and from current research which focuses on Rome that artists spent extensive periods of time, in some cases, their entire working life in the city.<sup id=\"fnref:60\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:60\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">60</a></sup> But the result for a city like Livorno is harder to read. Nonetheless the length of stay in Naples across these occupation groups indicates the greater depth of British engagement with the urban life in Naples by Grand Tourists.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-7a\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-7a.svg\" id=\"fig7a\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig7b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7c&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7d&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<a name=\"figure-7b\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-7b.svg\" id=\"fig7b\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig7a&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7c&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7d&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<a name=\"figure-7c\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-7c.svg\" id=\"fig7c\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig7a&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7d&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<a name=\"figure-7d\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"calaresu-figure-7d.svg\" id=\"fig7d\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig7a&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7b&apos;), getElementById(&apos;fig7c&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap7&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap7\">\n\n<b>Fig. 7:</b> The median number of days spent in each city by occupation of traveler. From top to bottom: diplomats, merchants, painters, and statesmen. While cases such as the merchants of Leghorn become difficult to compare, we can note the generally lengthy stays in Rome and Naples across occupations.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> allows us to easily compare the death dates of travelers against their time of travel to the city as another potential indicator of a length of stay. While more Britons “saw Rome and died” (64), there were a considerable number of British travelers who can be inferred to have died in Naples (40)—which echoes the expression in Italian, <em>Vedi Napoli e muore</em>. There were more deaths proportionally in Naples than in Florence (22) and Venice (17) where visitors often stayed for less time. In fact, the next largest number of British deaths after those in Rome and Naples are those in Livorno (70), which represents 7.2% of the overall number of travelers to the Tuscan port (977). At first glance, the number of deaths in Livorno appears representative of the resident community of merchants who, like <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2636\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Jackson</a>, lived their adult life there and became old in the city, and of the rich sources about the Leghorn cemeteries available to the <em>Dictionary</em>’s compilers, which is not available for other cities. Alternatively, it might have to do with the fact that British ships stopped in the port on their way to Britain, as it seems was the case for <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2874.3\" target=\"\\_blank\">Edward</a> (c. 1792-1797, travel year 1797) and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2874.2\" target=\"\\_blank\">Richard Lee</a> (c. 1791-1797, travel year 1797), who died at ages six and four years on their way from Smyrna, having lost <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2874.4\" target=\"\\_blank\">their sister</a> (c. 1792-1797, travel year 1797) in Naples on the way.<sup id=\"fnref:61\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:61\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">61</a></sup> We know that many British travelers in poor health went to Naples with the belief that the mild climate of the city would improve their health and we know that some of these “invalids” died there.<sup id=\"fnref:62\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:62\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">62</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>As these final figures demonstrate, British Grand Tourists engaged with Italian society beyond the buying of antiquities and visiting of churches on the shorter visits that were common in most of the cities of the Grand Tour. The evidence from Naples shows the many tourists stayed longer. Not unlike Rome, Naples offered many opportunities for tourists and, to some extent, artists—this might have changed over time as the sites of Herculaneum and Pompeii and their excavated treasures were unique draws to the city by the end of the eighteenth century. The evocative memoirs and paintings of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2715\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jones</a> clearly demonstrate the depth of the British engagement with Italian cityscapes, particularly that of Naples. The <em>Explorer</em> provides several methods for putting that knowledge in a greater context, to better understand whether Thomas Jones’ engagement with the city was as exceptional as it seems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></p>\n\n<p>For their advice or bibliographical help in the writing of this paper, I would like to thank John Gallagher, Simon Macdonald, Renaud Morieux, Katie Scott, Simon Schaffer, and especially Tim Spiers.

Numerous performer-impresarios crossed the Channel to tour throughout Europe and beyond offering spectacles geared around audacious equestrian displays.

The showman seen by Tornieri was probably <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/5031\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Wear</a> (travel year 1770), whose extensive Italian tour that year is widely documented.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Writing to the city authorities in Rome that summer, Wear introduced himself as a master horseman (<em>cavallerizzo</em>) wishing to show the public his <em>virtù</em> in this genre.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> Wear’s spectacular performances involved musical accompaniments, ambitious staging, and a range of publicity materials.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> At some point during his continental travels he had flyers printed illustrating his daring showmanship (<a href=\"#figure-1\">Figure 1</a>).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\"> <img src=\"macdonald-figure-1.png\" id=\"fig1\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1\">\n\n<b>Fig. 1:</b> Asner, <i>William Wear ecuyer anglois</i>, etching, n. d.

Another such troupe was led by <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3976\" target=\"\\_blank\">Peter Price</a> along with his <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3976.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">wife</a> (travel year 1782). When Price and his companions sought permission to perform in Rome, they boasted of previous performances before courtly audiences in Britain, France, Sardinia, Prussia, Poland and Russia. Describing their presence in Rome as part of a voyage which would ultimately take them to Constantinople, they asked for leave “to show in this Mother City the exercises of the <em>Knights of the English School</em>.”<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/5031\" target=\"\\_blank\">Wear</a>, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3976\" target=\"\\_blank\">Price</a> and the several other British <em>cavallerizzi</em> troupes who performed in Italy around this period have not yet received substantive historical study.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> But, as this essay will propose, these Italian journeys are of interest both in their own right and also as a basis for posing larger historical questions. Touring eighteenth-century Italian cities while feting <em>virtù</em> and gallantry tends to be associated with a very different—and much more abundantly studied—type of travel, namely the Grand Tour and its participants, a practice bound up with elite self-fashioning and the performance of socio-cultural distinction.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> For relatively plebeian commercial traveling performers to draw on such elevating language was to posit themselves as <em>virtuoso</em> knights engaged on their own kind of Grand Tour.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>This essay takes the idea of a parallel, juxtaposition or overlap between these very different social categories of traveler as a cue to explore questions about the actual social range of foreign visitors to Italy around this juncture. More specifically, it takes the case of these <em>cavallerizzi</em> as a vantage point for examining the prosopography of over 6,000 British and Irish travelers to Italy during the eighteenth century offered by the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em>. The <em>Explorer</em> allows a novel point of access to the mass of valuable research material presented in <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells (1997). Appraising the social range and representativeness of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s prosopography through the interface of the <em>Explorer</em> necessitates an understanding of the original book’s scope and its underlying sources. Reviewed in this light, the <em>cavallerizzi</em> are discussed here as a case study of the many possibilities—as well as some of the limitations—of prosopographical enquiry into the wider social field of British and Irish travelers to Italy (<a href=\"#figure-2\">Figure 2</a>).</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"figure-2\"></a></p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Entry in <i>Dictionary</i></th>\n      <th>Entry in <i>GTE<i></i></i></th>\n      <th>Sources in <i>Dictionary</i>/<i>GTE<i></i></i></th>\n      <th>Other Sources and Notes</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Wear</td>\n      <td>YES</td>\n      <td><a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/5031\" target=\"_blank\">YES</a></td>\n      <td>Verri, <i>Cart</i>. <br /> <i>Gazz.

I then turned to the <em>Explorer</em>—and especially to the word search feature it offers, which greatly facilitates access to the <em>Dictionary</em> text—in order to seek further such cases beyond those I had chanced upon during my initial archival research, before finally exploring further in additional sources. Happily, both <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/5031\" target=\"\\_blank\">Wear</a> and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3976\" target=\"\\_blank\">Price</a> do in fact have biographical entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>.

On the other hand, the entries in question comprise only a sentence or two, and, as will be seen below, not every British trick-rider who toured Italy made it into the text. This mixed coverage relates, in part, to the history of the <em>Dictionary</em> itself, of which the animating focus—and greatest strength in practice—is the Grand Tour milieu, rather than a complete prosopography of all British and Irish travelers in eighteenth-century Italy. New research by Giovanna Ceserani has helped establish how the <em>Dictionary</em> was greatly transformed over the long period of its development. As launched by Ford in the decades after the Second World War, the venture was initially envisioned within relatively confined art historical or antiquarian limits, and as a contribution to the history of taste and collecting. Over time, however, the scope of research expanded, and with it the remit of the ultimate publication.</p>\n\n<p>Elements of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s larger intellectual genealogy and context may also be suggested. First, the question of prosopography was, during the period of the project’s gestation, becoming highly topical among historians. This was especially the case in relation to the study of the eighteenth-century British political elite, notably in the wake of the influential work of Sir Lewis Namier.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup> Second, the project developed against the backdrop of what Peter Mandler has termed “sales of <em>virtù</em>,” that is, changes in ownership, over the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, of many of the private papers and collections which had been accrued during the eighteenth-century heyday of the Grand Tour.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> The dispersal of such material traces of the Grand Tour ultimately promoted wide-ranging efforts to record and study the eighteenth-century milieu involved in their initial fabrication, with the <em>Dictionary</em> offering a case in point.</p>\n\n<p>When the editorial decision was taken to produce a work which would no longer be delimited to a study of British artistic or Grand Tour-related engagement with eighteenth-century Italy, but rather an open-ended biographical dictionary attempting to document <em>all</em> travelers from Britain and Ireland to Italy during the period, this shift entailed drawing upon a larger constellation of sources, then tapping them more systematically. In particular, expanding the venture’s ambition in this manner meant that, besides focusing on sources produced by travelers themselves, research for the <em>Dictionary</em> would also involve the dedicated exploration of multiple Italian archival records. Indeed, one of the signal virtues of the published <em>Dictionary</em> is that it encompasses serious study of sources relating to the monitoring, administration, or “policing,” broadly understood, of foreigners in eighteenth-century Italy. Notably, for certain cities such as Venice, relatively thorough bureaucratic records survive describing arrivals and departures by given foreigners. And these kinds of administrative sources—names on lists and registers—form a low-profile but invaluable bedrock for the <em>Dictionary</em>’s prosopography, and help reveal a cast of historical actors far wider than the socio-cultural elite alone.<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In a schematic way, then, the eighteenth-century sources underpinning the <em>Dictionary</em> may be considered under two main headings. First, the book described British and Irish travelers from material largely stemming from their own records, collections and artistic productions. Second, it drew on documentation regarding such travelers and trajectories in Italian bureaucratic or policing archives. If the first set of sources are more qualitative—and indeed furnished much of the completed <em>Dictionary</em>’s word count and anecdotal color—then it might appear natural to consider the second as broadly quantitative. And yet, at least for the question of the social variety of travelers, this would be somewhat misleading. For not every foreigner was accorded even the basic official attention of having their arrival at a given Italian locale noted. In the Venetian registers for example—perhaps the single most extensive source of this kind used in the <em>Dictionary</em>—often only the nominal head, usually male, of a given traveling party is explicitly named; other family members and servants frequently went unlisted, unnamed, or otherwise under-described. More fundamentally, efforts by eighteenth-century bureaucracies to map people in movement were never a perfect dragnet.<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> Lists and registers produced by eighteenth-century Italian administrators represented a partially realized aspiration, and sometimes a deceptive simulacrum, of all-encompassing surveillance and control, rather than a reality of full coverage. The idea of total or encyclopedic coverage is itself a historical artifact, an ambition—or rather an illusion—which fascinated Enlightenment-era administrators, reformers and police. The <em>Dictionary</em>, and indeed the very idea of a “dictionary,” partly reproduces this illusion.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> gives the <em>Dictionary</em>’s sources, showing on which of these, and in what quantity, the entries in the text rely. Some sources on British and Irish travelers in Italy during the eighteenth century eluded the compilers of the <em>Dictionary</em>. That various private papers and other surviving miscellaneous records about individual trajectories were unavailable or missed in the book’s preparation is unsurprising, and does not in itself constitute a profound heuristic handicap. A vast amount of such material would be required to effect a drastic quantitative revision to the <em>Dictionary</em>’s prosopography as published in 1997. Even if this were achieved, it seems implausible that this would produce a dramatically different qualitative picture to the existing Grand Tour-centered one. Far more significant an omission, however, was that the <em>Dictionary</em> overlooked a major set of official records which are of considerable and distinctive prosopographical value, namely the registers of the British Protestant chapel at Livorno.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup> Held at the National Archives in London, the Livorno chapel records have to date received almost no scholarly attention.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> During the ninety-year period between the commencement of the chapel registers in 1707, until the temporary withdrawal of the British factory of merchants from Livorno in the late 1790s, more than 800 burials are listed, around 400 baptisms, and somewhat fewer marriages. On the face of it, these are significant figures to set against the approximately 6,000 traveling individuals that the <em>Explorer</em> has identified in its digital parsing of the entries from the <em>Dictionary</em>. Some of the names in the Livorno registers do already appear in the <em>Dictionary</em>, having been encountered via other sources. And indeed the compilers drew on one proximate source which has partial overlap with the Livorno chapel registers, namely a list of inscriptions in the British cemetery at Livorno—a work which is cited in approximately 130 entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> Others names from the registers would have been irrelevant for the <em>Dictionary</em>’s purposes, since not everyone featuring therein is British or Irish (and this is in fact part of their interest as a source). All told, had the Livorno chapel records been incorporated into the <em>Dictionary</em>, the result might well have been several hundred additional names. While representing a significant boost, this would not have radically transformed the size of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s coverage. This additional material would, however, have principally related to, and helped to further reveal, the mercantile face of British–Irish engagement with eighteenth-century Italy, instead of the more familiar Grand Tour ambit: this focus was presumably one reason why the Livorno registers went unnoticed in the first place. These remarks about the Livorno registers notwithstanding, the <em>Dictionary</em> does nonetheless feature many merchants, and the <em>Explorer</em>’s digital transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em>, allowing the aggregation of travelers that appear as merchants, both grants them more visibility and has been the basis for Reinert’s analysis of this component of the Grand Tour world.</p>\n\n<p>This review of sources animating the <em>Dictionary</em>’s prosopography might end there, were it not that, in the particular case of the <em>cavallerizzi</em>, one extraordinary additional document has recently come to light. This is a manuscript memoir which centers exactly around what its author dubs the “Break-neck Jockeyship” milieu.<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> The author in question, Thomas Hammond, worked as a servant for a trick-rider named James Wolton during an extensive continental tour which included a season spent crossing Italy in 1770. Hammond’s account reveals a host of fascinating specifics about the trick-riders’ multifarious—and skullduggery-filled—business arrangements. Above all it supplies the author’s own remarkable voice, opening a window onto his lived experiences and personal dramas. The production and survival of such a text, at this social level, is highly unusual. Set against the existing prosopography of the <em>Dictionary</em>, Hammond’s memoirs flesh out individuals and a milieu which otherwise would remain largely irrecoverable.</p>\n\n<p>Hammond’s picaresque narrative can only be briefly presented here. He introduces the other members of Wolton’s rackety operation, a young woman named Elizabeth Page—whom Wolton falsely presented as his wife—and “an English Lad call’d Peter, who spoke Italian.”<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> Hammond also describes encounters with competing British <em>cavallerizzi</em>, including a number of the figures noted at the start of this essay. Thus, before crossing the Alps, Wolton’s company met “Mr. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3976\" target=\"\\_blank\">Price</a> the famous rider.” He sought to discourage them from touring Italy, declaring “that it would not answer for we should only spend our Money and get Nothing.” But it subsequently transpired that Price’s comments about Italy “were lies that he forged to detain us from going there where he had never been, but where he intended to go.” The two parties crossed paths again in Turin, pragmatically agreeing to take different Italian itineraries so that “we may not be a hindrance to each other.”<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup> A subsequent encounter with another equestrian performer, our own <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/5031\" target=\"\\_blank\">Wear</a>, occurred just as Wolton was finalizing arrangements to perform in Venice. Such cases of crossing ways while abroad were also characteristic of the travels of more typical Grand Tourists, but this meeting occasioned a distinct outcome. Rather than seek to out-compete one another, Wolton and Wear entered into an uneasy provisional partnership. Hammond vividly described the spectacle as the audience arrived for their opening performance at “this water-built city,” held at a former riding school on the Giudecca:</p>\n\n<blockquote>… the great channel from St. Mark’s Square was Covered with Gondoloes full of Gentlemen &amp; Ladies all Mask’d, who being seated in the Ride, look’d like so Many specters, for their Masks were all white; and their coming over in those black Gondoloes looked as if they had been a troop of Ghosts that Mercury had conducted to the borders of the River Styx to be wafted over by the inexorable Charon into the Elysian fields, or Mansions of the Dead. However&#8212;Ugly as they were they brought us money, and we performed there twelve times[.]<span><sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>All of Wolton’s group, Hammond included, are conspicuously absent in the <em>Dictionary</em>. To this extent, Hammond’s memoirs attest to the imperfection of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s coverage, as discussed above.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> Yet they also substantiate its broader heuristic value, since the <em>Dictionary</em> in many ways helps make sense of an account such as Hammond’s, especially if it is digitally searchable as in the <em>Explorer</em>. Seen in this light, the <em>Explorer</em> can best be treated as an opportunity—as an invitation to take advantage of what this material does show us—rather than lamented for incompleteness where “completeness” was never possible. The <em>Dictionary</em> as it stands, and therefore the <em>Explorer</em>, represents a far-reaching compilation of surviving sources, including of the relevant Italian archival material. Notwithstanding its elite focus, the <em>Dictionary</em> also contains many sidelights on “lesser” travelers. While inviting reflections about the social range of travelers, the <em>Dictionary</em> also helps to elucidate the extent to which different social groups related to—or stood apart from—one another.</p>\n\n<p>Looking beyond the trick-riders, it is possible to discover at least glimpses of other more workaday or plebeian lives in the <em>Dictionary</em>, which is made easier by scrolling through “Employments and Identifiers” in the <em>Explorer</em>. In most cases, non-elite individuals appear therein because of client relationships with elite patrons, notably through work in service. One striking example from the world of court patronage is <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2721\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Joy</a> (1675-1734, travel years c.1702-33), who was “Strong Man to the Great Duke of Tuscany” over the early decades of the century. Many such individuals feature only fortuitously, often accorded brief entries because of some quixotic incident: <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3578\" target=\"\\_blank\">Richard Noakes</a>, a clockmaker, recorded in Rome in 1757 as having absconded with valuables entrusted to his care; <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/719\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Burton</a> (1730-1782, travel years 1775-1776 and 1782), a harpsichordist who died of fever in Naples in 1782, while in the employment of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/334\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Beckford of Fonthill</a> (1759-1844, travel years 1780-81, 1782 and 1792); and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/753\" target=\"\\_blank\">Mrs. Mary Cadogan</a> (d. 1810, travel years 1786-1800), the daughter of a Welsh shepherd, and more famous for being the mother of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2205\" target=\"\\_blank\">Emma Hamilton</a> (1765-1815, travel years 1786-1800). Like the trick-riders, in many ways it is impressive that such figures appear at all in the <em>Dictionary</em>, yet all the aforementioned are simultaneously absent in the sense that their entries are relatively sparse or vacant.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> Furthermore, the <em>Dictionary</em>’s construction tends to obscure numerous other non-elite individuals. For example, it frequently clusters references to whole traveling parties in a single entry for one dominant individual, thereby reproducing eighteenth-century social hierarchies. It is notable as well that the <em>Dictionary</em> has no entries under the name “Anonymous.” One advantage of the <em>Explorer</em> is to render more visible all manner of individuals—named and unnamed—either with the creation of new entries when the digital parsing has identified these travelers, or by searching the text for given keywords, such as “servant” or “maid.” Other keyword search results, however, are more salutary in obliging us to recall quite what a pale reflection the <em>Dictionary</em> can provide of the true proportions of non-elite travel. Thus, only one sailor, a certain <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1892\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Gardener</a> (travel year 1747), appears to have received a dedicated entry: yet presumably the number of British and Irish mariners to have made port in Italy over the course of the century would have easily exceeded the total number of entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Equally, while the discussion here has focused on the challenges of exploring the social range of British and Irish travelers to eighteenth-century Italy through the <em>Dictionary</em>, many of the same considerations apply for additional, and sometimes overlapping, occluded groups and categories. At all social levels, women seem to be underrepresented in the <em>Dictionary</em> by comparison to their male fellow travelers. The <em>Explorer</em>’s digital transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em> has sought to correct this underrepresentation, at least by creating new entries for travelers (largely women) previously subsumed in others’ entries, as in the case of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3976.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Price’s wife</a>. Sweet’s essay in the present collection has used this new data for innovative analysis, while certainly it remains true that more women traveled than we can ever recover by what the surviving sources record. Searching the <em>Explorer</em> for keywords relating to British colonial worlds produces far more references to individuals enriched by the spoils of empire than to subaltern lives, albeit that there are a handful of exceptions to this. For example, the entry for an “English Catholic from Barbados” named <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/62\" target=\"\\_blank\">Allen</a> (travel years 1728-30) states that “one of his black slaves became a Christian” in Rome in 1729; the <em>Explorer</em> created a new entry for this <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/62.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">slave</a>, but the question persists of how many others remain unmentioned and forgotten.[^33] Furthermore, as the example of the <em>cavallerizzi</em> suggests, the <em>Explorer</em> can be used to trace terms relating to non-human actors and travelers, notably horses but also other animals. For instance, one contemporary account describes <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1760\" target=\"\\_blank\">Martin Folkes</a> (1690-1754, travel years 1733-35) going to Rome in 1733 “with his wife and daughters, dog, cat, parrot and monkey.”<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>This essay began by highlighting how elements of the trick-riders’ self-presentation echoed the Grand Tour model. Evaluating this parallel illumines the equivocal profile that the <em>cavallerizzi</em> came to receive in the historical record—and in the <em>Dictionary</em>—but also points to what made them prosopographically distinctive. Much of their interest, indeed, relates to how they upend traditional Grand Tour frameworks. They came to Italy not to spend money, consume culture, or acquire <em>virtù</em>—nor were they part of the baggage train of Grand Tourism and its associated trades, arts and services. Rather, they were already <em>virtuosi</em> in their field, and were in Italy to make instant money from their own ephemeral productions: their displays were voguish lowbrow entertainment rather than higher-brow fare indebted to classical or artistic canons. This British engagement with Italy was more a matter of export than of import, and more an epiphenomenon of eighteenth-century “Anglomania”—in this case centered around horse husbandry and sporting spectacle—than of fascination with Italy’s cultural capital.<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> Indeed, some of the trick-riders scarcely wished to be there, and were touring abroad simply as a contingency after having been shouldered out of the hyper-competitive “Harlequin Horsemanship” market in Britain itself.<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, one reason we are able to reconstruct these trajectories in any detail is precisely because they also had notable points of proximity and even overlap with the Grand Tour. Newspaper reports advertising <em>cavallerizzi</em> performances shared column space with reports of foreign grandees’ comings and goings. Their displays were often enacted on terrain best-known for Grand Tourism and for antiquarian interests. It was partly the presence of foreign tourists with money to spend which made Italian cities such conspicuous centers for elite consumption, including furnishing a key public for the kinds of crowd-pleasing spectacles that the <em>cavallerizzi</em> were in the business of selling. Horsemanship was itself a characteristic which could bring together diverse social categories: the art of riding was an attribute both of circus performers and of grandees.<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup> The <em>cavallerizzi</em> serve, too, as a reminder that social status was not fixed, and that the purpose of a sojourn in Italy was—at all social levels—performative, competitive and even transformative. The servant Thomas Hammond provides a remarkable example of this. Not only did Hammond transcend societal expectations by writing up his memoirs, so immortalizing his life and career, but one of his text’s delights is its shifting linguistic registers—including, as we have seen, describing scenes he observed in Venice by invoking analogies with classical mythology (“those black Gondoloes looked as if they had been a troop of Ghosts that Mercury had conducted to the borders of the River Styx to be wafted over by the inexorable Charon into the Elysian fields”), thus further announcing his autodidactic virtuosity.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if some of the considerations discussed here highlight the need, when using the <em>Explorer</em>, to recognize the various layers of source production, survival, selection and interpretation which have structured its contents, they also help provide an intellectual genealogy for the project itself. The “art of travel” as constructed during the early modern period was entangled with observation, recording, and collecting.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup> But so, too, were host governments anxious to register and measure the movements and activities of foreigners in their midst. One of the points of interest of the <em>Dictionary</em> is precisely that, in its ambitious and innovative source base, it brings together these two documentary impulses. In terms of social coverage, the results are, if not straightforwardly quantitatively representative, nevertheless of often impressive variety. The <em>Explorer</em> gives us new ways of approaching this material, and indeed of reading the <em>Dictionary</em> against the grain of its original intentions. The <em>Dictionary</em> was presented as having been primarily designed to answer questions, “were they in Italy?” and if so, “when and where.”<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup> The <em>Explorer</em>, however, permits us not only to revisit such questions, but to frame new ones. As this essay has sought to show, approaching this material by searching not for a named or notable individual, but instead for wider socio-cultural categories and careers, can help reveal a host of more eclectic and obscure personal trajectories, with potentially kaleidoscopic results.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></p>\n\n<p>Research behind this essay was funded by a Rome Scholarship at the British School at Rome (2010–11), and a Max Weber Fellowship at the European University Institute, Florence (2015–16).

        "content"  : "<p>My interest in the Grand Tour explorer arises out of my own work on the engagement of British travelers with Italian cities during the long eighteenth century. Some years ago, I published a book that concentrated upon British experiences and representations of Italian cities during the long eighteenth century, Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c. 1690-1820.1 As an urban historian, I was less concerned with what was collected or purchased by travelers, or with their social networks, than with exploring how images of major Italian cities were constructed and considering their influence in British culture. Given the opportunity to work with the Grand Tour Explorer, I wanted to use it to pursue several questions.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Like many historians, years of immersion in the primary sources meant that I had an intuitive sense of evolving patterns of travel and the composition of the traveling body. However, I was unable to provide any rigorous quantifiable basis for my conclusions or generalizations. How far were my generalizations borne out by the evidence of the Explorer, while taking into account the complex nature of its data, which we know to be far from complete (see the introduction of the book)? What new light could the Explorer cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the Explorer tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body? The dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste, acquired and polished in Italy, exercised such a powerful influence upon Britain’s eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.2 But it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic grand tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out throughout my book was the increasing presence of both female travelers and travelers from beyond the landed elite over the course of the eighteenth century, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book: Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile: such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa and Leghorn.</p>\n"

        "content"  : "<p>By the seventeenth century, British travelers had already caught the travel bug. They expressed sentiments strikingly similar to those of modern globetrotters. An early “Grand Tour” account, <em>Coryat’s Crudities</em> (1611), satirized how even the hint of foreign climes could infect an armchair traveler:</p>\n\n<blockquote>A Dutch Post doth ravish him. The mere superscription of a letter from Zurich sets him up like a top: Basil or Heidelberg makes him spinne. And at seeing the word Frankford, or Venice, though but on the title of a Booke, he is readie to breake doublet, cracke elbowes, and overflowe the roome with his murmure…<span><sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>This was wanderlust as mania, brought on by an increasingly interconnected world. Adventurers were tempted by the Dutch packets, Swiss letters, and Italian books that had made their way North as far as Oxford and London. Thomas Coryate and many of his compatriots answered their siren calls, setting forth from their armchairs into the wider world.</p>\n\n<p>Coryate would later claim to have walked much of his journey from France to Italy and the Netherlands. His book begins with several poems referencing his shoes, which hung for many years at his local church in Somerset. But Coryate did not always walk: even at the outset of his journey, he described his wanderlust in terms of how ardently he desired “having trussed up his necessaries, and packed up his fardels, to draw on his bootes, put his riding hat upon his head, raise himselfe upon his wings, hoise sailes, and mount on horsbacke (according to the proverbe) and post the neerest way to forraine and remote Nations.”<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Sentences like these hint at the variety of travel modes available in seventeenth-century Europe. Coryate’s reference to the ravishing “Dutch Post” as a noun parallels the modern use of “post” as a synonym for “mail.” Both the noun and verb, “to post,” had only recently entered the British lexicon, from the Italian term for a staging post, or waystations that enabled riders to travel in relay.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> When Coryate used “post” as a verb instead and synonym for travel (to “post the nearest way”) he used even newer slang. The proliferation of “to post,” “go by post,” or travel “post-haste” demonstrated that the import of European travel modes to Britain was intertwined with the arrival of British tourists in Europe.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>When it works well, travel infrastructure is virtually invisible. Instead, we often find mentions of its perceived failures. Take, for example, free word searching in the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> for “postilion” (a guide hired from the post): <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2843\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Lewis Langton</a> (c.1716-1738, travel years 1737-1738) was “much harrassed by postillions, inn-keepers and coaching accidents,” while <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4434\" target=\"\\_blank\">Tobias Smollet</a> (1721-1771, travel years 1764-1771) wrote that “the hostlers, postilions, and other fellows hanging about the post-houses in Italy, are the most greedy, impertinent, and provoking.” The Hon. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/766\" target=\"\\_blank\">Benedict Leonard Calvert</a> (c.1701-1732, travel years 1724-1725) had good reason to complain when his postilion drove into a ditch, breaking the chase and forcing him to return to Rome rather than journey onwards to Naples. Travelers complained at length about the behavior of postilions, poor condition of paved roads, and inadequacy of travel inns. Coryate’s work and hundreds of other British travel narratives are often analyzed for the sensory or philosophical experience of travel.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> Such sources do provide vivid details of exceptional experiences, but more mundane infrastructure frequently escapes notice.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth considering instead that such complaints reveal high expectations.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> By the beginning of the seventeenth century, British tourists expected a great deal of a comprehensive travel infrastructure that had simply not existed in past centuries. The history of travel necessitates quantitative, in addition to qualitative, evidence. The <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> offers a unique opportunity to study travel patterns across space, time, and political boundaries. With this broader perspective, we can determine how representative the most famous and widely published travelers were. This essay will set out to do so with an experience common to all Grand Tourists: their arrival in Italy. British travelers faced an arduous journey before ever reaching Italian soil. The compilers of the <em>Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em> were not preoccupied with that journey, yet as the <em>Explorer</em> reveals, the entries preserve many traces. Around 150 locations outside of Italy appear in the tour information, constituting 34.3% of all locations recorded, the majority of which lie North of the Alps.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>To date, Mont Cenis has traditionally been identified at the preferred Alpine Pass of the Grand Tour. Jeremy Black wrote that “the most common route into Italy was from Lyons through the Duchy of Savoy, over the Mt. Cenis pass to Susa, and thence to Turin.”<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> Christopher Hibbert similarly saw most Grand Tourists as venturing first to France, before choosing “to cross the Alps either through Grenoble, Briancon, and Cesana, or through Geneva and Switzerland,” while “the most usual route was by way of Lanslebourg and Susa over Mont Cenis.”<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> Recent authors are more equivocal, but the Savoyard route continues to receive the most scholarly attention.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> Other essays in this volume use free word searches to great effect, but the approach offers little guidance in this instance. Searches of the entry text and locations for famous Alpine passes (see <a href=\"#figure-1\">Figure 1</a>) turn up very little information: Mont Cenis returns the greatest number of results with 44 matching entries, while searching for the Brenner pass produces only five entries, the St. Gotthard only two, and the St. Bernard passes do not appear at all.<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup> Instead, this essay will seek to read across the geography of the tour data to infer regions of entry into Italy and the modes of travel being used. Inferring the Alpine pass of entry into Italy from the <em>Explorer</em> data reveals that traveler choices were more varied than typically assumed and often tied to travel infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>This essay also seeks to elucidate the British arrival to Italy as an overall historical phenomenon. The <em>Dictionary</em> bisects the history of travel with a largely arbitrary date of 1700. By putting study of the <em>Explorer</em> in dialogue with earlier sources—including Thomas Coryate, among many others—we may better understand the <em>longue durée</em> of the Grand Tour, as well as its significance as a reflection of improving travel infrastructure.<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> Postal routes and waystations marked improvements in “soft infrastructure” that predated many road engineering projects. Alpine passes were fundamentally limited in number in the early modern world, and very little construction to add new routes took place between the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries.<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup> The travel of eighteenth-century British Grand Tourists can be fruitfully compared to earlier centuries as a reflection of the shifting preferences and conditions for, rather than geographical possibilities of, transalpine travel.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\"> <img src=\"midura-figure-1.png\" id=\"fig1\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1\">\n\n<b>Fig. 1:</b> Map of Alpine passes and “indicator” cities, which have been used to infer probable routes of entry into Italy.

The Roman Empire established an early pattern of travel infrastructure radiating outwards from Italy into other parts of Europe. The Via Julia Augusta (c. 13 B.C.E.) followed the coast of Liguria, linking Genoa to Marseille, while the Via Claudia Augusta (c. 46/47 C.E.) linked the Veneto region to the Tyrol and beyond, by way of the Reschen and Brenner passes. Archaeological evidence indicates additional Roman roads in the region of the Simplon pass in the first centuries of the new millennium, likely related to the campaigns of Septimius Severus I (193-211 C.E.).<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> Grand Tourists primarily remembered exceptional Alpine crossings, from Hannibal’s legendary elephants (218 B.C.E.) to Charlemagne (800 C.E.) and Frederick Barbarossa’s imperial armies (c. 1154-1175 C.E.).</p>\n\n<p>While Roman infrastructure fell into disrepair, smaller-scale mobility continued throughout the Middle Ages. Transalpine trade linked the hubs of Northern Italy with France, particularly the trade fairs in the region of Champagne. The closure of these fairs in the early fourteenth century saw a rise in traffic across the eastern Alpine passes, as merchants sought new transalpine connections between Bologna, Venice, Nuremberg, and Augsburg. Some merchants even took basic road building into their own hands: Bozen merchant Heinrich Kunter sponsored the building of a mule road through the Eisack gorge along the Brenner pass in 1314.<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> In the sixteenth century, the Fugger family of merchant-bankers paid to revitalize parts of the Via Claudia Augusta, referred to as the <em>Römerstrasse</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Transalpine regions had been the birthplace for much of early modern travel and communication infrastructure. The Tassis family—whose ancestral home in Camerata Cornello was located along the medieval Via Mercatorum—were one of several families contracted to build and manage routes for early modern states. Better known by their later title of Thurn und Taxis, this communications dynasty played a crucial role in the Venetian, Papal, Spanish, and Austrian Habsburg systems from the fifteenth century onward.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> Responding to news-hungry patrons, from princes to bankers, they established postal routes dotted with waystations and horses kept ready for riding in relay. Many of these waystations were themselves inns, where the innkeeper might rent out horses to travelers when they were not otherwise in use. The Tassis established such waystations along historical routes from Milan to the Netherlands through Chur in 1496, and from Milan to Innsbruck in 1517.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup>\nTo travel “by the post” encompassed several modes by as early as the sixteenth century. The first was to rent a “post horse,” then travel with or without a guide (a “postilion,” or <em>postiglione</em>) along the postal road, paying a fee for the return of the horse to its owner at the end of the journey. The second was to travel by one’s own means along the postal road, taking advantage of the stops. The British adopted the Italian <em>ordinari</em>, which usually referred to couriers traveling on a set timetable, to refer instead to the “ordinaries,” or postal inns. By the early seventeenth century, the third option was often to travel via a public postal coach, often referred to as the “post-chaise” (from the French) or “diligence” (from the German).<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>By the mid-seventeenth century, the British were frequently as steeped in the culture of postal transport as their Continental counterparts—despite the relatively late advent of their own state-run service.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> The language of the post percolated from Italy across Europe in the sixteenth century: <em>posta</em>, <em>ordinario</em>, <em>procaccio</em> (a single route carrier), <em>vetturino</em> and <em>nolesino</em> (referring to coaches for hire). The term “post-haste” made a notable appearance in Shakespeare’s plays.<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup> British translators made postal itinerary books available to English audiences with Richard Verstegan’s <em>The Post of the World</em> (1576), James Wadsworth’s <em>The European Mercury</em> (1641), and Edmund Warcupp’s <em>Italy in its Original Glory</em> (1660).<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The paths of British travelers were dispersed across a broad geography from their points of entry onto the Continent, but they were grouped together once more upon reaching the Alps. Liguria had several coastal routes, including the aforementioned Via Julia Augusta through Savona. Travelers coming from Geneva often crossed Savoy and traveled through the Mont Cenis and St. Bernard passes (known as the “Little,” and “Great,” respectively); meanwhile Lombardy channeled travelers from other parts of Switzerland through the Simplon, St. Gotthard and San Bernardino passes. Finally, the Venetian/Tyrolean region received tourists from southern Germany and Austria, most often via the Brenner pass.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n    \n<a name=\"figure-2\"> <img src=\"midura-figure-2.jpeg\" id=\"fig2\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>\n    \n<figcaption id=\"cap2\">\n \n<b>Fig. 2:</b> Wilhelm Rothe, according to drawings by Johann Gottfried Jentzsch. <i>Grande roûte au mont St. Gotthardt, en Suisse non loin de l'Hospice di Jentzsch</i>. c. 1790-1800.

Most land routes had long portions that could only be passed on foot, on mule, or by sedan chair. Early seventeenth-century traveler Fynes Moryson presented a particularly vivid image. He described pressing his face to his horse’s neck, fearing he would fall at any minute.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> Thomas Coryate recalled the storms during his summer passage of 1608 through Savoy as particularly horrible.<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> In the later seventeenth century the Alps occasioned less fearful commentary. With the exception of his fear of the “rough way,” Richard Lassels described his 1650s voyage through the Simplon Pass as “forward enough,” barring poor weather. He particularly endorsed the route through Mont Cenis, describing it as the Alps in “text hand,” comparing the topography to neat script, as opposed to areas that seemed “foule over” or “in a running hand.”<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> François Misson offered one of the first proto-Romantic accounts of the Alps, writing that “their Snowy tops are mingled with the Clouds, and resemble very much the swelling and foaming Waves of a tempestuous and raging Sea.”<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> The growing geological and scenographic attraction of the Alps for British travelers is a well-documented phenomenon.<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a name=\"figure-3\"></a></p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Travel Account</th>\n      <th>Travel Dates</th>\n      <th>Region(s) of Entry to Italy</th>\n      <th>Region(s) of Departure from Italy</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Thomas William</td>\n      <td><i>The Historie of Italie</i> (MS)</td>\n      <td>1540s</td>\n      <td>Naples</td>\n      <td>Lombardy</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Thomas Hoby</td>\n      <td><i>A Book of the Travaile and Lief of Me Thomas Hoby</i> (MS)</td>\n      <td>1547-1564</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Sir Edward Unton</td>\n      <td>Diary (MS)</td>\n      <td>1564</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n      <td>Lombardy</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Sir Phillip Sidney</td>\n      <td>Letters (MS)</td>\n      <td>1575</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n      <td>Veneto/Tyrol</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Fynes Moryson</td>\n      <td><i>An Itinerary..

The seventeenth century lacks a published prosopography of the depth and scale of the <em>Dictionary</em>, leaving the researcher largely reliant on individual published accounts.<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup> We can infer three general trends from these accounts: first, they demonstrate that seventeenth-century travelers employed a variety of passes, with some preference overall for the Venetian/Tyrolean and Lombard routes— most likely the Brenner and Simplon passes. Protestants like Fynes Moryson professed fear of capture by Spanish troops and inquisitors, but it was hard to beat these regions for travel infrastructure in the seventeenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> Venice and Milan were notable centers of early Tassis postal development with well-developed postal roads and travel modes for rent. A longstanding agreement between Milan and the merchant porters of Lindau in Bavaria became a more formalized postal route by the late seventeenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> By 1710, four-span carriages traveled along the postal road between Innsbruck and Bolzano three to four times a week.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> Second, we see that many early travelers, like their later counterparts, preferred to exit Italy from a different region than they entered, likely motivated by a desire for travel breadth and variety. Finally, many of these examples confirm that travelers preferred the dangers of the Alps to the perils of the sea.<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The analysis shown in <a href=\"#figure-3\">Figure 3</a> has distinct limitations. These are but a handful of travelers, and each identification requires consulting their accounts individually. We are left with little sense of how representative these journeys were, or of how trends evolved over time. By contrast, the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> allowed me to rapidly infer the regions of entry of eighteenth-century British travelers into Italy. This approach was made possible by both the constrained geography of alpine passes and the sequential records of locations provided in the <em>Explorer</em> entries. If an individual is first recorded in Turin and then Milan, for example, it is a reasonable inference that they entered Italy by way of a Savoyard alpine pass. Clues can be read alongside select traveler accounts as well as supplemented by a knowledge of contemporary travel infrastructure. While closer to Verona than Milan “as the crow flies,” Mantua had long been integrated into Habsburg transit infrastructure in northern Italy. It is reasonable to infer that a traveler who arrived in Mantua did so by way of the Lombard passes, especially when such an arrival was not preceded by any mention of cities in the Veneto or Tyrol regions.\nIt is important not to overdetermine the specificity of results from such a method. It would be misguided, for example, to infer a single route. Regional groups instead represent collections of routes, such as “Lombardy,” which encompasses the Simplon, St. Gotthard, or San Bernardino passes, among others. These regional groupings and their associated cities can be found listed in the legend and color-coded accordingly in <a href=\"#figure-1\">Figure 1</a>. They are necessitated by both the ambiguities of real geography and that of travel modes. Arrival in a port city such as Venice or Genoa might indicate a journey by sea rather than over land. Definitively parsing all instances would require archival study outside of the <em>Explorer</em>. We can, however, see whether the trajectory of travel through the Tyrol/Veneto more closely parallels that of a region reached by port, such as Tuscany, or regions reached primarily by land, such as Lombardy.<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> While imperfect, such an inferential methodology fills in for a noteworthy absence. Alpine passes rarely appear by name in entry texts, and even more rarely as explicit destinations.</p>\n\n<p>The method is also not appropriate for use with all traveler entries. The following analysis uses a subset of 1090 travelers from the <em>Explorer</em> for which a region of entry into Italy can be reasonably inferred, based on two criteria: first, each traveler has to be associated with at least three locations overall. Second, departure from the first location in Italy (regarded as the point of entry) must be followed by another location recorded within the month. This selection is intended to serve as a counterweight to sparse data. It is difficult to say whether a traveler recorded in only a single location entered Italy in that manner, or whether three locations visited over the course of several decades should constitute a sequence of travel. These strict criteria produce a small subset compared to the <em>Explorer</em>’s total of 6,005 travelers, but a large one by comparison to any hand-selected subset, such as that shown in <a href=\"#figure-3\">Figure 3</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\"> <img src=\"midura-figure-4.png\" id=\"fig4\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig3&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\n<b>Fig. 4:</b> Line graph demonstrating the identified region of entry of 1090 travelers prior to 1800.

In fact, travelers appear to have preferred the Venetian/Tyrolean region through the first half of the eighteenth century. And while the Savoyard passes maintained a steady flow of travelers during periods of French-English warfare from 1771-1790, the Tyrolean/Venetian region boomed by comparison.<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup>\nMany of the caveats that hold true for the original biographical dictionary still necessarily apply, and the <em>Explorer</em> introduces some additional ones. For example, the lifespan of certain sources certainly impacts recorded travelers. As explained in Ingamells’ original “Note on Method” and <a href=\"/gt-book/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled\" target=\"\\_blank\">mentioned by Rosemary Sweet</a> and others, the University of Padua matriculation records were the source for a great number of the overall travels to the city recorded in the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup> These records became less comprehensive over time. Additionally, the Explorer’s transformation of the Dictionary’s entries disaggregated some large groups of travelers, perhaps disproportionately affecting the data for my study. See, for example, the numerous family of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4692\" target=\"\\_blank\">Rev. Edward Taylor</a> (1734-1798, travel years 1789-1792), many of whom accompanied him from Austria to Verona in 1789, and who constituted 10 of the 21 travelers recorded entering via the Tyrol/Veneto that year.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Even given these limitations, the data supports that travelers continued to prefer the Tyrolean/Venetian region as a pass of entry. While Grand Tour literature has tended to link British travels in Italy with travels in France, the data indicates the need for deeper consideration of Austria and Germany as pre-Italian destinations. These regions had their own appeal to travelers like <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2188\" target=\"\\_blank\">Sir James, the 4th Baronet Hall</a> (1761-1832, travel years 1784-1785), who spent a year in Central and Eastern Europe studying “mining, archaeological sites and volcanology.” Many travelers through the Tyrolean/Venetian region came from Vienna. Some were more traditionally elite tourists, such as <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2203\" target=\"\\_blank\">Douglas Hamilton, the 8th Duke of Hamilton</a> (1756-1799, travel years 1775-1776), who traveled with tutor <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3413\" target=\"\\_blank\">Dr. John Moore</a> (1729-1802, travel years 1775-1776), or <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1030\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lady Coke</a> (1726-1811, travel years 1773-1774), who greatly admired the Empress Theresa and reputedly displayed a “frenzy for royalty.” Yet a number of these travelers held military commissions and visited Vienna, then Venice, during the conflicts of the mid-1770s, perhaps during their military studies—see, for example, the Hon. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3175\" target=\"\\_blank\">Robert Manners</a> (1758-1823, travel year 1779) and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/5229\" target=\"\\_blank\">Nathaniel William Wraxall</a> (1751-1831, travel year 1779).<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The city of Venice was itself a popular draw for tourists, raising the issue of how closely entry through a given region can be associated with the popularity of its cities. If we look at the overall popularity of Venice as a destination across the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> data, we see that it does not map exactly onto the preference for the Tyrol/Veneto as a region of entry. The city of Venice experienced a surge of travelers from 1761-1770, when the Tyrolean/Venetian passes were at an overall low point in popularity.<sup id=\"fnref:40\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></sup> In fact, the popularity of a city may have had a greater impact on tourists’ choice to end, rather than begin, a journey in that region. A sea voyage from Venice would notably allow tourists to ship home art and other objects collected in the course of their journeys.</p>\n\n<p>The Imperial and Venetian posts were among the most advanced and comprehensive postal infrastructures of the early seventeenth century. It was possible to travel by Imperial post alone from the Netherlands to Innsbruck, where the passage to Venice by coaches for hire was run by a consortium of Augsburg merchants. Misson highlights the stage coaches that went from Augsburg to Venice as early as the 1680s.<sup id=\"fnref:41\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></sup> Despite the attempts by the Thurn und Taxis postmasters to combat their competitors, there were a number of such regional postal systems that connected major trade centers in the Holy Roman Empire, and no doubt eased British travel.<sup id=\"fnref:42\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></sup> For travelers concerned by the practicalities of reaching Italy, the journey through Central Europe rather than France held a certain appeal.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5\"> <img src=\"midura-figure-5.png\" id=\"fig5\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig3&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap5\">\n\n<b>Fig. 5:</b> Line graph demonstrating the shifting numbers of travelers entering via the Tyrol/Veneto and Savoy regions. Visualization smoothed by moving average of +5/-5 years. \n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>When was the turning point in favor of the Mont Cenis and St. Bernard passes, and Savoy as a region of entry? In 1720, Victor Amadeus II, the Duke of Savoy became the King of Sardinia, turning his court into a royal one. Travelers such as the <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/556\" target=\"\\_blank\">Rev. Thomas Brand</a> (c.1751-1814, travel years 1782-1784, 1787, 1790-1795) delighted in court life, describing how “we go on in the old way playing snug rubbers at Whist at the Spanish Ambassadors &amp; dressing ourselves two or three times a week to shew off our persons to advantage &amp; captivate the hearts &amp; Eyes of the great Circles.” Yet the <em>Explorer</em> data shows no immediate change, and few travelers entered through Savoy in the 1720s.<sup id=\"fnref:43\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></sup> A much more notable increase began in the 1750s, reaching a peak of 25 identified travelers in 1763 (24 of the 39 identified travelers for that year, or 62%). <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4475\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Spencer, the 1st Viscount Spencer</a> (1734-1783, travel years 1763-1764, 1769-1770), was the leader of a particularly large and well-documented entourage that year, however there was a general pattern of increasing traffic. Travelers tended to arrive in Savoy en route from Paris (23 travelers), Geneva (13 travelers), and Nice (11 travelers). In 1743, Savoy gained possession of the Val d’Ossola and Val Anzasca passes from Austrian Lombardy. A new agreement between Savoy and Bern the next year restructured and facilitated transit between the two regions. Yet in 1748, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2575\" target=\"\\_blank\">David Hume</a> (1711-1776, travel year 1748) and his companions remained unimpressed by the bad roads of Turin, which caused delays from the “breaking of Wheels.”</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the Austrian Habsburgs set out an ambitious program for infrastructural reform. From the middle of the eighteenth century, they controlled both the Lombard St. Gotthard and Venetian Brenner passes. In the 1750s and 1760s, Empress Maria Theresa seized control of the Tyrolean postal service and implemented renewal of both the system itself and the roads. The Imperial Post achieved a major coup in 1764 by successfully negotiating a mail coach to supplement the existing line across the Brenner pass. Even travelers who utilized private carriages benefited from the associated improvements. As overall British tourism increased, the Tyrolean/Venetian region saw a large proportion of visitors, notably outpacing Savoy once again by around 1774.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-6\"> <img src=\"midura-figure-6.png\" id=\"fig6\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig3&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap6\">\n\n<b>Fig. 6:</b> Line graph demonstrating the shifting numbers of travelers entering via Liguria and Tuscany. Visualization smoothed by moving average of +5/-5 years. \n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>While Grand Tour scholars like Jeremy Black have indicated that war caused little disruption in existing travel patterns, it does appear that soured Anglo-French relations may have made a significant difference.<sup id=\"fnref:44\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></sup> Bianchi notes that the Savoyard route was largely closed to British travelers in the 1740s as a result of the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748).<sup id=\"fnref:45\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></sup> The period of the American and French Revolutions also saw a dip in overall travelers, reaching a particular low in 1781, when only 217 travelers are recorded in the <em>Explorer</em>. Only one of these has been identified as entering Italy via the given regions in this year: the Hon. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3492\" target=\"\\_blank\">Gen. James Murray</a> (1719-1794, travel years 1781-1782), who fled the French siege of Minorca. The anomalous peak in travelers entering Italy via Liguria in 1778 (9 of 25 identified travelers that year, or 36%) was likely due to restricted options. The very next year saw the capture of the Westmoreland and plunder of many Grand Tourist souvenirs by Spanish ships.<sup id=\"fnref:46\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></sup> Occupations rather than tourism brought others to Italy, such as the surgeon <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/855\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Gideon Caulet</a> (travel years 1778-1779), or the musician <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1215\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Crosdill</a> (1755-1825, travel year 1778).</p>\n\n<p>Do these shifts show a corresponding shift in preference for travel by sea or travel by land? If that were the case, we would expect to see Lombardy and Savoy (land routes) peak in periods when Liguria and “Other” (a category including most regions that could be reached only by sea) were at a low, and vice versa (see <a href=\"#figure-4\">Figure 4</a>). We instead see a more complex picture: Liguria and Tuscany show an inverse relationship, particularly from 1778 forward (see <a href=\"#figure-6\">Figure 6</a>). The rivalry of ports seems a more influential factor: as the popularity of the port of Leghorn grew, the popularity of the port of Genoa fell, at least with British Grand Tourists.<sup id=\"fnref:47\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Across the graph, we see several phases of regional preferences for entry into Italy. The overall increase in travelers over the course of 1720s and 1730s likely continued trends from the later seventeenth century. Early travelers appreciated the convenience and safety of continental postal routes, particularly the coaches run over the Brenner pass. From around 1730 forward, the number of travelers through this region dwindled, reaching a low around the beginning of the 1750s, just as the Savoyard passes increased in popularity. The timing suggests that infrastructural reform, rather than the new royal court, likely played a role. Subsequent decades saw important reforms by the Austrian Habsburgs, including consolidation and improvement of postal routes, particularly the advent of an official postal coach across the Alps. During the troubled decades of the 1770s and 1780s, most regions saw fewer travelers entering Italy, leaving Liguria briefly prominent among entry points. By the 1790s, tourism had recovered somewhat overall, but entry via Venice reached record numbers, and the Tuscan port of Leghorn showed steady growth, suggesting perhaps a new turn to travel by sea, even in the age of rising tourist interest in the Alps.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tastemakers and Mont Cenis: Traveler preferences for arrival into Italy</strong></p>\n\n<p><a name=\"figure-7\"></a></p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Titled Status</th>\n      <th>Liguria</th>\n      <th>Lombardy</th>\n      <th>Savoy</th>\n      <th>Tyrol/Veneto</th>\n      <th>Tuscany</th>\n      <th>Other</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>All</b></td>\n      <td><b>12.05%</b></td>\n      <td><b>3.43%</b></td>\n      <td><b>18.54%</b></td>\n      <td><b>20.67%</b></td>\n      <td><b>19.37%</b></td>\n      <td><b>31.23%</b></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Men (all)</b></td>\n      <td><b>11.12%</b></td>\n      <td><b>3.19%</b></td>\n      <td><b>19.27%</b></td>\n      <td><b>20.26%</b></td>\n      <td><b>19.16%</b></td>\n      <td><b>32.05%</b></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Untitled Men</td>\n      <td>9.94%</td>\n      <td>3.04%</td>\n      <td>19.06%</td>\n      <td>18.65%</td>\n      <td>19.34%</td>\n      <td>34.12%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Titled Men</td>\n      <td>15.76%</td>\n      <td>3.80%</td>\n      <td>20.11%</td>\n      <td>26.63%</td>\n      <td>18.48%</td>\n      <td>23.91%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Women (all</b>)</td>\n      <td><b>16.96%</b></td>\n      <td><b>4.68%</b></td>\n      <td><b>14.62%</b></td>\n      <td><b>22.81%</b></td>\n      <td><b>20.47%</b></td>\n      <td><b>26.90%</b></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Untitled Women</td>\n      <td>13.74%</td>\n      <td>6.11%</td>\n      <td>12.21%</td>\n      <td>24.43%</td>\n      <td>16.79%</td>\n      <td>30.53%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Titled Women</td>\n      <td>27.50%</td>\n      <td>0.00%</td>\n      <td>22.50%</td>\n      <td>17.50%</td>\n      <td>32.50%</td>\n      <td>15.00%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n\n<figcaption><b>Fig. 7:</b> Table showing regional distribution by traveler gender and titled status (travelers of unknown gender not shown).

Some, like the composer <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/5047\" target=\"\\_blank\">Charles Weichsell</a> (c.1766-1805, travel years 1794-1801), landed first in Naples.<sup id=\"fnref:49\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:49\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></sup> Untitled men arriving via the Alps seem most likely to have done so via Savoy.\nTitled men were more likely to travel by way of the Ligurian route than their untitled counterparts. Many travelers came to Genoa from France, often taking a felucca, a type of rowboat, as Joseph Addison described in his published account: “we here took a little Boat to creep along the Sea-shore as far as Genoa; but at Savona, finding the Sea too rough, we were forced to make the best of our way by Land, over very rugged Mountains and Precipices: For this Road is much more difficult than that over Mount Cenis.”<sup id=\"fnref:50\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:50\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">50</a></sup> <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2121\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Egerton, Baron Grey de Wilton</a> (1749-1814, travel years 1785, 1788), recorded his journey from Nice to Genoa by sea in 1784, staying at the <em>Hotel du Grand Cerf</em> in Nice before departing for Genoa on a felucca. Many tourists opted to enter Italy via Liguria while on their second tour, perhaps suggesting a desire for speed rather than sightseeing; this includes <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2592\" target=\"\\_blank\">Alexander Gordon, Marquess of Huntly</a> (c.1678-1728, travel years 1703-1704, 1717), in 1717 and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3919\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Fermor, the 1st Earl of Pomfret</a> (1698-1753, travel years 1718-1719, 1739-1742), in 1739. Titled men similarly preferred the Tyrol/Veneto passes, however among men of both statuses, the distribution between Savoy and Tyrol/Veneto was relatively even.</p>\n\n<p>The routes of female travelers—who often traveled with, or were recorded by, other male travelers—map onto male travel patterns with a few interesting exceptions. First, both titled and untitled women were more likely to arrive via Liguria than their male counterparts. Many of their entries describe travel by sea. Examples include <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/852\" target=\"\\_blank\">Miss Mary Anne Cathcart</a> [Mary Mainie] (1727-1774, travel years 1744-1746), who journeyed from Lisbon to Genoa in 1744, and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2533\" target=\"\\_blank\">Laetitia Houblon</a> (1742-1828, travel years 1788-1789) and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/5012\" target=\"\\_blank\">Betsy Watson</a> (travel years 1788-1789), who came from Nice in 1788.\nSecond, titled women appear more likely to arrive via Tuscany than any other group. 13 of the total 35 identified titled female travelers were first recorded in Pisa, Lucca, or Florence. Their arrival by sea is rarely explicitly mentioned in the entries, but can be reasonably inferred.<sup id=\"fnref:51\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:51\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></sup> Similarly, while the complete absence of titled women entering Italy via Lombardy may be a simple lack of data, it does seem to overall be one of the least popular routes for female travelers. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3324\" target=\"\\_blank\">Anne Miller</a> (1741-1781, travel years 1770-1771), <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3880\" target=\"\\_blank\">Hester Piozzi</a> (1741-1821, travel years 1784-1787), and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4512\" target=\"\\_blank\">Mariana Starke</a> (1762-1838, travel years 1792-1798) came to Italy by way of Savoy, although Starke recommended that travelers avoid the Alps by sailing to Leghorn or Pisa.<sup id=\"fnref:52\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></sup> The possibility that women increasingly found sea travel more commodious than travel by land is worthy of further exploration. It may well have offered more privacy and safety to women who could afford it. The published travel accounts of elite men and women also routinely advertised the Savoyard route as one of the safest and most pleasant, likely influencing future travelers.</p>\n\n<p>At this point in time, we may merely indicate that as recorded by the <em>Dictionary</em>, there was a general preference for arrival via either the Tyrol/Veneto or Savoy Alpine passes, from which certain key groups diverged. Women on the whole were more likely to arrive via Liguria than men, most likely by sea. Titled women were especially likely to arrive via Tuscany, although Savoy was also widely popular. If we consider only travelers prior to 1751, we see that these gender and titled status patterns generally hold true across time, despite the overall balance between Savoy and the Tyrol/Veneto being more evenly distributed in the earlier half of the century.\nThe prescriptiveness of published Grand Tour accounts, which sought to instruct their readers in the “correct” tour, have contributed to the notion of a single Grand Tour itinerary. We see from this study how titled men and women, particularly during the peak years of the eighteenth-century tour, preferred a Savoyard route, no doubt contributing to the scholarly perception. Yet as several essays in this volume demonstrate, British travelers planned different “tours” on the basis of their gender, professions, means and personal desires. Travel experience was also shaped by changing roads and travel modes, which were subject to periodic tides of interruption, destruction, and renewal. \nThe <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> offers us the unique ability to read travel itineraries across time, while considering such varied perspectives. We see evidence for continuity in travel patterns from the late seventeenth century into the eighteenth, as tourists continued to visit Austria and Germany as well as France prior to their Italian arrival. The postal infrastructural improvements made in Savoy likely contributed to its brief peak as the predominant pass of entry, but the restructuring of the Tyrol/Veneto regional infrastructure brought it back to prominence by the end of the eighteenth century. However, not every group experienced these shifts to the same degree: women overall showed an early and consistent preference for travel by sea. Titled women had a strong early preference for Tuscany and Savoy, suggesting they may have played an important role as “tastemakers.” The <em>Explorer</em> on the whole highlights the diversity of tours, and the many factors guiding British travelers to their arrival in Italy.</p>\n\n<div class=\"dataButton\" onclick=\"window.open('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u8d7Gr20n87ei8LSrWYMtKGVdsJUE20OPDVCZOu7zn8/edit#gid=1645203115','mywindow');\">Download and explore the data behind this essay</div>\n\n<h3>References</h3>\n\n<div class=\"overlay\" id=\"popup\" style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column; flex-wrap: wrap; background: #f7f6f3\">\n    <div id=\"imgs\" style=\"height:80%\">\n        <div class=\"overlay-close\">\n            <a><i class=\"material-icons\">close</i></a>\n        </div>\n        <img id=\"img\" />\n        <img id=\"img2\" />\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"capWrapper\" style=\"height:20%\">\n        <p id=\"cap\" style=\"float:left; max-width:80%; position:relative; left:120px; display:inline-block\"></p>\n        <div style=\"display:inline-block; float: right\">\n            <div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column; position:relative; right:100px; top:20px\">\n                <i class=\"material-icons link-cite\" aria-label=\"Cite this image\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">format_quote</i>\n                <i class=\"material-icons link-copy\" aria-label=\"Copy link to this image\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">link</i>\n                <i class=\"material-icons\" aria-label=\"Download\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">arrow_downward</i>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nfunction zoom(obj, obj2, caption) {\n    var popup = document.getElementById(\"popup\");\n    popup.style.maxHeight = \"90%\";\n    popup.style.height = \"90%\"\n    var image = document.getElementById(\"img\");\n    var image2 = document.getElementById(\"img2\");\n        \n    image.src = obj.src;\n    image.style.display = \"block\";\n    image.style.marginLeft = \"auto\";\n    image.style.marginRight = \"auto\";\n    image.style.left = \"0\";\n    image.style.right = \"0\";\n    image.style.width = \"100%\";\n    image.style.height = \"100%\";\n    image.style.objectFit = \"contain\";\n\n    image2.style.display = \"none\"; // hide in case Fig 1 or 2 were clicked\n    document.getElementById(\"capWrapper\").style.width = image.offsetWidth;\n\n    if (obj2 != undefined && obj2 != null) { // Figure 1 & 2 are paired\n        image.style.float = \"left\";\n        image.style.width = \"50%\";\n\n        image2.src = obj2.src;\n        \n        image2.style.display = \"block\";\n        image2.style.marginLeft = \"auto\";\n        image2.style.marginRight = \"auto\";\n        image2.style.left = \"0\";\n        image2.style.right = \"0\";\n        image2.style.float = \"left\";\n        image2.style.width = \"50%\";\n        image2.style.height = \"100%\";\n        image2.style.objectFit = \"contain\";\n\n        document.getElementById(\"capWrapper\").style.width = image.offsetWidth + image2.offsetWidth; \n    }\n    var cap = document.getElementById(\"cap\");\n    if (caption != undefined && caption != null) {\n        cap.innerHTML = caption.innerHTML;\n        cap.style.display = \"block\";\n        cap.style.marginTop = \"20px\";\n    } else {\n        cap.style.display = \"none\";\n    }\n    var overlays = document.getElementsByClassName(\"overlay\");\n      for (overlay of overlays) {\n        overlay.classList.remove(\"visible\");\n      }\n    popup.classList.add(\"visible\"); \n}    \n</script>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>Thomas Coryate, <em>Coryats Crudities: Hastily Gobled Up in Five Months Travells in France, Savoy, Italy, Rhetia Commonly Called the Grisons Country, Helvetia Alias Switzerland, Some Parts of High Germany and the Netherlands</em> … (London: Printed by W.S.

        "content"  : "<p>The Grand Tour was critical to establishing the demand for many of the resources and phenomena that we associate with modern cultural tourism, such as maps, guidebooks, itineraries, souvenirs, and tour guides. On his visit to Rome in 1644, the British writer John Evelyn toured with one of the latter, “who get their living onely by leading strangers about to see the Citty.”<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Scant information survives on seventeenth-century guides, but the call for their services continued as the popularity of travel grew. Known in the eighteenth century as <em>ciceroni</em> or cicerones, guides explicated the great antiquities, artworks, buildings, and sights of Italy to visitors who came from all over Europe to see them.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Tourists, especially young men for whom travel was intended to be educational, may also have been escorted by “bear leaders,” tutors, or governors, but these were chaperones rather than guides and sometimes accompanied their charges on tours with <em>ciceroni</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> This essay will examine the work of <em>ciceroni</em> and the experiences of their clients on the Grand Tour.</p>\n\n<p>Although there have been a few studies of individual <em>ciceroni</em>, they have not been considered systematically as a group. Relatively few <em>ciceroni</em> are known to us, most of them British, along with some Italians and at least one German. The fundamental published source for many of these figures is John Ingamells’ <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Ford archive, but it is not indexed, so information can be difficult to find in its entries.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> The <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em>’s digital transformation of the <em>Dictionary</em> allowed me to begin a more thorough study of the subject.</p>\n\n<p>The terms <em>cicerone</em> (singular) and <em>ciceroni</em> (plural) do not appear among the <em>Explorer</em>’s “Employments and Identifiers,” which are descriptors that in the <em>Dictionary</em> follow the names of around 15% of the travelers. Related terms do appear, however, including “antiquarian,” and “antiquary.” Using the <em>Explorer</em>’s free word search is another way in, as searches for “cicerone” and “ciceroni” bring up forty-seven entries. Through a combination of the “Employments and Identifiers” filter and the use of free searches for terms including “antiquarian,” “antiquary,” <em>cicerone</em>, <em>ciceroni</em>, and “tour guide,” I was able to compile a list of fifteen <em>ciceroni</em> (<a href=\"#figure-1\">Figure 1</a>).</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"figure-1\"></a></p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><em>Cicerone</em></th>\n      <th>Clients identified (hover cursor to see names)</th>\n      <th>Number of clients identified</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Francesco de’ Ficoroni (1664-1747)</td>\n      <td><a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/29\" title=\"Joseph Addison\" target=\"\\_blank\">●</a> <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/292\" title=\"Hon.

Rome, the exception being <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/952\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Clark</a> (c. 1754-1800, travel years 1768-1800), who was a guide in Naples. With its unique abundance of monuments, Rome was a place where tours were especially desirable. As the seat of the Jacobite court in exile, it was home to many British Catholics; a number of the <em>ciceroni</em> on my list were Scottish Jacobites or sympathizers. British guides usually had travelled to Rome to study painting, less often sculpture or architecture, but may not have been so successful in those professions and at any rate developed a great interest in antiquities and cultivated their knowledge of them.</p>\n\n<p>The first known <em>cicerone</em> of the eighteenth century appears to have been an Italian, Francesco de’ Ficoroni (1664-1747). A native of Lazio, Ficoroni was the most sought-after antiquarian in Rome from 1690 to 1745. In addition to working as a <em>cicerone</em>, overseeing excavations, and publishing his scholarship, he collected and dealt in antiquities, as did many antiquarians, connoisseurs, scholars, and tour guides. As Tamara Griggs has demonstrated, Ficoroni’s contribution to guiding was to adapt the Roman tradition of antiquarianism to the interests of Grand Tourists.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In his <em>Osservazioni di Francesco de’Ficoroni sopra l’antichità di Roma</em> of 1709, Ficoroni listed an array of aristocratic clients whom he had led around Rome, particularly the catacombs, evidence that the services of <em>ciceroni</em> were already popular at the beginning of the eighteenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> His clients hailed not only from Britain, but also from France, Sweden, Denmark, Flanders, Holland, and Germany. Did Ficoroni speak to them in Italian? In the seventeenth century Italian was an international language of diplomacy and music; travelers may have had some knowledge of it, but how many could have fully understood it and conversed in it? This factor may partly account for the popularity of British <em>ciceroni</em> among a tourist population dominated by Britons. Nonetheless, Ficoroni’s first recorded client was the well-known British politician and writer <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/29\" target=\"\\_blank\">Joseph Addison</a> (1672-1719, travel years 1700-1701), who is documented to have been the first to use the term <em>ciceroni</em> in 1726.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>A later Italian <em>cicerone</em> was Ridolfino Venuti (1705-1763), a highly respected scholar who was appointed <em>Commissario delle Antichità</em> (Prefect of Papal Antiquities) in 1744.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> One of the duties of the papal antiquarian was to guide important visitors around Rome, but according to Venuti’s famous successor in the post, Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Venuti was unable to live on his salary of 180 <em>scudi</em> per annum and took on other wealthy travelers as clients to supplement his income, a practice which apparently proved quite lucrative. Winckelmann succeeded Venuti in 1763, the only non-Italian to ever hold the position, an indication of the esteem in which the German antiquarian was held.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> He did not share his predecessor’s interest in escorting travelers around Rome, especially the British and the French, whom he respectively regarded as humorless and frivolous. He was, of course, more tolerant of Germans, especially Prince Leopold III of Anhalt-Dessau, whom he described as a “German Achilles.” Winckelmann’s tours, as we will see, reflected his idiosyncratic perspective on ancient art.</p>\n\n<p>Venuti also supplemented his income by writing guidebooks.

He entered the service of the Pope as captain of the papal galleys, but was also well known among British tourists as an antiquarian in Rome. Eventually denounced by the Jacobites as a Hanoverian spy, Parker was banished by the Inquisition in 1749 and ultimately settled in Paris. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3732\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Parker</a> (fl. 1740-d. 1765, travel years 1740?-c. 1762), an unsuccessful  history painter unrelated to Mark, attempted to succeed him as a <em>cicerone</em> but failed, no doubt partly due to his quarrelsome nature. It was <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4179\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Russel</a> (c. 1720-63, travel years in Italy 1740-1763), who, despite being exposed as a Jacobite by John Parker, his rival for the succession, eventually followed Mark Parker as <em>cicerone</em> to the British.<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> Russel was indeed a Jacobite, from a family staunchly of that persuasion, and was rigorously educated in the classics, which nourished the growth of his antiquarian interests in Rome. He went there to study painting, which he did at the French Academy, and achieved moderate success as an artist, mostly in copying famous works for tourists. He also served as an agent for other artists. His best-known painting is a so-called “conversation piece”, set in a Roman interior, in which he pictured himself with tourists who were fellow Jacobites, wearing a tartan coat to show his sympathy for the Stuart cause.<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The major Roman <em>ciceroni</em> of the later eighteenth century were <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Colin Morison</a> (1732-1810, travel years 1754-1810), and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Byres</a> (1734-1817, travel years 1758-1790).

Norton solidified the association by marrying Byres’ niece, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3748.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Janet Moir</a>, in 1792. By that time Byres’ nephew and Janet’s cousin, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3364\" target=\"\\_blank\">Patrick Moir</a> (1769-1810, travel years 1785-1805), himself a respected antiquarian who had already been living with his uncle, took over Byres’ business as a <em>cicerone</em> and dealer.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> Norton lived until 1799 and Moir stayed in Rome until 1805, both carrying on in the tradition of Byres.</p>\n\n<p>As these examples show, leading tours was one of a constellation of activities in which antiquarians and connoisseurs, many of whom were also artists, participated in Rome. Only some of the <em>ciceroni</em> cited here—those who were able to establish a large and steady clientele—may have considered guiding tours a primary career and source of income. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4179\" target=\"\\_blank\">Russel</a>, for instance, worked both as an artist and led tours. In a letter of 1753 to a fellow client of Russel, the scholar <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4469\" target=\"\\_blank\">Joseph Spence</a> (1699-1768, travel years 1731-1733, 1739-1741) wrote that, “There are so many rivals in Painting, that if our friend Russel can get the English at Rome as sole <em>cicerone</em>, it may possibly prove the more beneficial profession.”<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup> Indeed, Russel’s work as a tour guide ultimately took precedence over his artistic pursuits.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes <em>ciceroni</em> traveled with their clients, but they might have found it more lucrative to remain at the site of business. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morison</a>, for example, accompanied <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1718\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Ogilvy, 7th and 4th Earl of Findlater and Seafield</a> (1750-1811, travel years 1771-1773), in Europe and northern Italy but charged him £600 to make up for income he forfeited by leaving Rome. Roman <em>ciceroni</em> did, however, lead tours in nearby towns with popular sights: for instance, in 1777 <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Byres</a> guided a party of three in Tivoli, Albani, and Frascati (see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sYLwFqOfIlRu3bfxCbbYMZhVo_wGiiLdQ_BUEjwnrPw/edit#gid=1805869645\" target=\"\\_blank\">Appendix</a>). Other kinds of work that <em>ciceroni</em> did, such as writing guidebooks, making copies, and collecting and dealing, including procuring export licenses, also participated in the economy of the Grand Tour.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Travelers, for their part, came to expect these services, while guides profited, sometimes shamelessly, through duplicitous or shady practices. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2680\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jenkins</a> (1722-1798, travel 1751-1798), for example, would overcharge unwitting clients and pass off modern objects made under his supervision, such as cameos, as antiques.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> Others bought artworks, either ancient or modern, and arranged for them to be exported without procuring the requisite licenses from the papal antiquarian, who controlled their issuance.<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup> <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a>, for instance, secretly negotiated for the Boccapaduli family to sell their coveted series of paintings of the seven sacraments by the great seventeenth-century French artist Nicolas Poussin to the Duke of Rutland.<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> These celebrated pictures were such a tourist attraction, however, that they were replaced with copies, which Byres then passed off as the originals. Similarly, Ficoroni failed to inform the papal antiquarian of a work he had acquired through an excavation, an antique head of porphyry that he had bought “from certain masons who had found it in a dig,” and was put on trial and fined.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Clients</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> was essential to identifying the clients of <em>ciceroni</em>: as many as 118 of the 134 in my list appear in the <em>Explorer</em> (see <a href=\"#figure-1\">Figure 1</a>). The remaining sixteen I identified through other sources. Other travelers who toured with <em>ciceroni</em> were identified in the <em>Explorer</em>, but because their guides were not named they don’t appear on the client list.

Patoun seems to have worked more as a bear leader than a <em>cicerone</em>; a few of his charges appear in the <em>Explorer</em>. In 1775 he accompanied one of them, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3957\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis</a>, on a tour conducted by <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Byres</a>.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> It is hard—maybe impossible—to know how many more travelers than those I identified were guided by <em>ciceroni</em>, which should be kept in mind in considering the information presented here.</p>\n\n<p>Most of Ficoroni’s clients, whom he listed in his own publication, appear in the <em>Explorer</em>.

The <em>Explorer</em> also reveals that <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/952\" target=\"\\_blank\">Clark</a>, the major <em>cicerone</em> of Naples, sometimes served as a guide for the same clients led by <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morison</a> (<a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3935\" target=\"\\_blank\">Porter</a> and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4163\" target=\"\\_blank\">Rowley</a>) or <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a> (<a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/611\" target=\"\\_blank\">Brooke</a> and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3741\" target=\"\\_blank\">Parkinson</a>, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2121\" target=\"\\_blank\">Egerton</a> and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1823\" target=\"\\_blank\">Foxley</a>) in Rome, supporting the notion that <em>ciceroni</em> tended to establish their businesses in particular cities and stay there. However, I found only one traveler who toured with two different <em>ciceroni</em> in the same city: in Rome, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/324\" target=\"\\_blank\">Elizabeth Berkeley, Duchess of Beaufort</a> (1719-1799, travel years 1771-1774), visited the Colonna Palace with <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2680\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jenkins</a> in 1773 and St. Peter’s Basilica with Byres in 1774.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> confirms that <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morison</a> and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a> were two of the most popular guides of their day. Nonetheless, one <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/553\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Brand</a> (c. 1717-1770, travel years 1738-1739, 1754-1755) commented that Morison and his client, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1159\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Coussmaker</a> (1759-1802, travel years 1783-1784), “were like ‘a hen with a single chicken,’ while James Byres escorted a party of seven at the same time.” Indeed, Byres had by far the most clients on my list—forty-nine, including a party of seven in 1784—while Morison is most well known as the <em>cicerone</em> of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/509\" target=\"\\_blank\">James Boswell</a> (1740-1795, travel year 1765), biographer of the writer Samuel Johnson. Capitalizing on their positions, Morison and Byres sometimes acted as agents or dealers for those they guided, Morison for <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2445\" target=\"\\_blank\">Richard Colt Hoare</a> (1758-1838, travel years 1785-1787, 1788-1791) and Byres for <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/5279\" target=\"\\_blank\">Philip Yorke</a> (1757-1834, travel years 1778-1779), but clients of one <em>cicerone</em> sometimes used another for that purpose, too.</p>\n\n<p>What can be gleaned from the biographical information for clients derived from the <em>Explorer</em> (see <a href=\"#figure-2\">Figure 2</a>)? To begin with professions, including future careers, we can see that statesmen top the list by more than thirty, with writers and scholars together and military officers second and third. As for university, the largest number of clients went to Oxford, then to Cambridge by little more than half the amount, with Eton and Westminster the most popular schools. My survey of groups, women, and families indicates that a number of clients toured together. Clients toured with traveling companions, bear leaders, tutors, governors, their families, and were occasionally paired with strangers. I was not surprised to find that a large number of clients were titled or royal, though less than half of all, but did expect there to be more Catholics, the church and its art and architecture being one of the major attractions of travel to Italy.</p>\n\n<p>I was a bit surprised that so few of the clients I tracked became members of learned societies, especially the Dilettanti, the existence of which was predicated on the Grand Tour. Nor did many clients become important patrons of the arts like <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3013\" target=\"\\_blank\">Charles Long</a> (1760-1838, travel years 1786-1788), who was a trustee of both the British Museum and the National Gallery, or <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3919.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lady Pomfret</a>, who donated a collection of ancient sculpture to the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> However, some American colonists guided by <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a> returned to play significant roles in their fledgling country.<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup> Two were prominent Philadelphians and two were from Boston; on their tour in 1764 they probably would have considered themselves to be Britons. Three proved loyal to the colonies; only one, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3714\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Palmer</a> (1743-1820, travel year 1764), left America in 1776. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3429\" target=\"\\_blank\">Dr. John Morgan</a> (1735-1789, travel year 1764), a prominent physician, returned to Philadelphia to found the American Philosophical Society and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3953\" target=\"\\_blank\">Samuel Powel</a> (d. 1793, travel year 1764), both the last colonial and the first post-colonial mayor of Philadelphia, joined the society.</p>\n\n<p>My client list mentions a few travelers who guided their companions, but were not themselves professional <em>ciceroni</em>, such as <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2437\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Coxe Hippisley</a> (1747-1825, travel years 1799-1780, 1793-1795, 1818), later a baronet, who guided <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2363\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Augustus Herbert, Lord Herbert</a> (1759-1827, travel years 1779-1780), in Rome in 1779, though Herbert had engaged <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/952\" target=\"\\_blank\">Clark</a> in Naples. Some artists and scholars took visitors sightseeing on occasion. The painter and antiquarian <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2207\" target=\"\\_blank\">Gavin Hamilton</a> (1723-1798, travel years 1748-1750, 1756-1798), for example, led a party of tourists to see his excavations at the site of the ancient city of Gabii, outside of Rome.<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> Similarly, the great German writer Johann Wolfgang Goethe noted in his Grand Tour journal that his countryman, Johann Friedrich Reiffenstein, an antiquarian and artist who lived in Rome, sometimes showed visitors around the city and planned activities for them.<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> also references <em>ciceroni</em> other than those on my list, but most are otherwise unknown, even if named. Among those named are Britons and a few Italians, some of whom worked in cities other than Rome and Naples: a Pietro Paolo Pizoli in Bologna and an Abbé Pilori in Florence. Clients’ comments make clear that elite <em>ciceroni</em> were in competition with shady or less qualified ones. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2363\" target=\"\\_blank\">Herbert</a> noted that one Raphaeli, a <em>cicerone</em> in Naples, stole things. According to Johann Jakob Volkmann, a well-educated German who toured with Winckelmann, “Most of these antiquaries are abbots [abate was an honorific title for a cassock-clad layman] who work in the field as manual laborers. Without possessing science or taste, they learn their routine by heart…baptize the statues according to their will, and give false names to the pictures. Most of the pieces are called <em>cose stupende</em> [stupendous things] with no discrimination, but they can very seldom conduct the art lover to true beauty and to the building of his taste,” which was Winckelmann’s goal.<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup> Similarly, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/167\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Edward Ayscough</a> (d. 1779, travel year 1770), a soldier and dramatist, described the <em>ciceroni</em> of Rome as “a set of scurvy abbati’s to whom foreigners pay a settled salary, and give constant place at their table, to be led about like bears by these learned [his italics] gentlemen…whose interest it is never to let him leave Rome while he can show him a broken pillar, a mutilated statue, or a single classical vestige of any kind whatever.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Tours</strong></p>\n\n<p>What were the tours led by elite <em>ciceroni</em> like and what were their clients’ experiences? By the late eighteenth century these tours must have been fairly standardized, though my research confirmed that they could vary in length, the sights that were seen, and the amount of time spent touring each day. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3413\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Moore</a> (1729-1802, travel years 1775-1776), a physician and writer who visited Rome in 1775-76 in the company of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2203\" target=\"\\_blank\">Douglas Hamilton, the 8th Duke of Hamilton</a> (1756-1799, travel years 1775-1776), described his tour in the account he wrote of his travels. “What is called a regular course with an Antiquarian, generally takes up about six weeks; employing three hours a day, you may, in that time, visit all the churches, palaces, villas, and ruins worth seeing, in or near Rome….[T]here are about thirty palaces in Rome, as full of pictures as the walls can bear…There are also ten or twelve villas in the neighborhood of this city, which are usually visited by strangers.”<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup>  Winckelmann’s excursions reportedly lasted more than three hours a day, extending from nine in the morning until three or four in the afternoon.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a> and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morison</a> expected twenty sequins (<em>zecchini</em>) for a course, “and thirty if two companions.”<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup> When Byres’ handed his business over to Moir, however, the uncle advised his nephew to charge £50 or £100 per person, and recommended that parties should comprise “five or not more than seven.” He further noted that select travelers should be entertained with “a Hansom Breakfast, Dinner or Supper.” According to <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3769\" target=\"\\_blank\">Patoun</a>, <em>ciceroni</em>, not their clients, should also pay “the servants who shew the palaces.”<sup id=\"fnref:40\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></sup> He suggested three pauls for a small palace, five for a larger one, and half a sequin for the Colonna and Barberini palaces. Who were the servants to whom Patoun was referring? Did they give tours of the palaces or merely provide access? One possibility is that they were high-ranking servants who cared for the household property of elites, some of whom acted as advisers, agents, or curators for their employers’ collections.<sup id=\"fnref:41\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In preparation for touring, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3769\" target=\"\\_blank\">Patoun</a> advised travelers to read Venuti’s guidebook to Roman antiquities, recommending “the Night before the Chapter…that describes the quarter or particular Piece of Antiquity which you are to see with your Antiquarian the day following. By this means you will go informed to a great degree, and of course perceive clearer Ideas, and be more able to make proper questions, when any doubt arises.”<sup id=\"fnref:42\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></sup> Similarly, Winckelmann noted that tourists were ill prepared for sightseeing and planned to write a guidebook for Germans to read before departing their homeland.<sup id=\"fnref:43\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The quality of the tour would have depended of course upon the quality of the guide. As has been suggested, many tours were probably not like those given by the elite <em>ciceroni</em> on my list. Moreover, there is not a great deal of information on the more elite tours and the relative merits of their guides, and some of it is contradictory. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3769\" target=\"\\_blank\">Patoun</a> said that “<a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morisson</a> is esteemed the best Medallist &amp; Classic Scholar, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a> the most agreable &amp; communicative….They are both Originally Painters, and of course know the Pictures as well as the Antiquities,” which was an important qualification. “Having a regard for both, I cannot recommend one in preference to the other.”<sup id=\"fnref:44\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></sup> However, clients complained that both these <em>ciceroni</em> were given to moodiness and pedantry.<sup id=\"fnref:45\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>More seems to be known about <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a>’ tours than those of others, thanks to the survival of descriptions by clients. Apparently Byres had no fixed itinerary, but determined his course by the weather, “antiquities and ruins when fine, statues and palaces when wet,” and pictures on clear but unpleasantly windy days. Two of his clients mentioned above, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3953\" target=\"\\_blank\">Powel</a> and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3429\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morgan</a>, took a three-week course with Byres in the spring of 1764 (the recommended season) and kept notes on what they saw in Rome.<sup id=\"fnref:46\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></sup> Most such courses began with a visit to the Capitoline Hill, as did <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/509\" target=\"\\_blank\">Boswell</a>’s tour with <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morison</a>; there the <em>cicerone</em> would point out the seven hills and principal sights of antiquity.<sup id=\"fnref:47\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></sup> Powel and Morgan, however, started with the Vatican Palace and St. Peter’s Basilica, spending four days there in all. During the rest of the week they visited the Villa Farnesina and the Palazzo Farnese as well as other palaces. They also heard a papal mass at the Oratorian church of S. Maria in Vallicella, called the Chiesa Nuova (new church).</p>\n\n<p>In the second week of their tour, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3953\" target=\"\\_blank\">Powel</a> and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3429\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morgan</a> focused on seeing collections in palaces and stopped in various churches along their way. On the weekend they visited the Capitoline Hill and its buildings, including the museum, the basilica of S. Paolo Fuori le Mura (St. Paul Outside the Walls), and the Villa Albani. The final week of Powel and Morgan’s tour began with a trip to the Colosseum and included the Baths of Titus and Trajan, more palaces, and the Villa Borghese. On the last day they were “presented to His Holiness.” This course seems to have been somewhat light on the antiquities—they didn’t go to the forum, for instance—which may have reflected the weather conditions or the preferences of the clients, as their tour was rather short.</p>\n\n<p>In educating his charges, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a> displayed his antiquarian and connoisseurial skills, explaining the historical and literary contexts of ancient monuments and sites and appraising the quality of both antiquities and early modern paintings, as was appropriate to the understanding of these works in the eighteenth century. Although his courses were sometimes described as dry or dull, he would interject amusing anecdotes. For example, Byres told <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3953\" target=\"\\_blank\">Powel</a> and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3429\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morgan</a> that the bare-shouldered figure of “Justice” (actually <em>Truth</em>) on Gianlorenzo Bernini’s tomb of Alexander the VII in St. Peter’s was “so admirable that it caused a Workman to attempt to enjoy her, after which the Pope caused a Drapery of Brass to be put over the Body.”<sup id=\"fnref:48\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:48\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></sup> The story is apocryphal, of course, but it points up Byres’ classicizing taste and demonstrates how <em>cicerone</em> could mediate their clients’ experiences through their own preferences. If Byres disliked Bernini’s unrestrained baroque style, he might have objected even more to Caravaggio’s unidealized naturalism, for he didn’t even show his clients the artist’s great paintings of St. Matthew in the Contarelli chapel when they visited the church of S. Luigi dei Francesi.<sup id=\"fnref:49\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:49\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></sup> Byres’ taste may have been influenced by that of Mengs, his teacher, but even Mengs was less rigid; the <em>cicerone</em>’s preferences rather harken back to the strict standards espoused by the antiquarian and critic Giovanni Pietro Bellori in the later seventeenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:50\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:50\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">50</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Winckelmann shared <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a>’ neoclassical taste, though his tours were reportedly livelier. Volkmann, who visited the Vatican Palace with Winckelmann, described the reaction to his <em>cicerone</em>’s enthusiastic commentaries: “The papal guards stood there with open mouths completely astonished and maybe thought that malaria had disturbed his brains.”<sup id=\"fnref:51\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:51\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></sup> Winckelmann had been reading to Volkmann from his manuscripts on some of the antiquities, such as the <em>Apollo Belvedere</em>. His comments must been like the rhapsodic passage on that statue in one of his later publications: “My chest seems to expand with veneration and to heave like those I have seen swollen as if by the spirit of prophecy, and I feel myself transported to Delos and to the Lycian groves, places Apollo honored with his presence.”<sup id=\"fnref:52\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Winckelmann’s dramatic responses to ancient statuary, which he hoped to cultivate in others, seem to have remained unique among <em>ciceroni</em> but not tourists. Roman antiquities had sparked the imaginations of travelers long before the eighteenth century; the reactions of Grand Tourists, especially Britons, are particularly distinguished by their excited visualizations of the distant past. Educated in the classics, many of these travelers were routinely prompted by the material remains of antiquity to imagine the ancient world, enthusiastically reconstructing it in their minds through historical and literary association.<sup id=\"fnref:53\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:53\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></sup> Indeed, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3049\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lumisden</a> noted in the guide he wrote to Rome that, “…on the spot we read them [the classics] with an additional enthusiasm,…”<sup id=\"fnref:54\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:54\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">54</a></sup> Thus the historian <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1935\" target=\"\\_blank\">Edward Gibbon</a> (1737-1794, travel years 1764-1765) recalled the beginning of his Roman tour with <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/747\" target=\"\\_blank\">Byres</a>, which inspired him to write his famous history of Rome:</p>\n\n<blockquote>My temper is not very susceptible of enthusiasm, and the enthusiasm which I do not feel I have ever scorned to affect. But at the distance of twenty-five years, I can neither forget nor express the strong emotions which agitated my mind as I first approached and entered the <i>eternal City</i>. After a sleepless night, I trod, with a lofty step, the ruins of the Forum; each memorable spot where Romulus <i>stood</i>, or Tully spoke, or Caesar fell, was at once present to my eye; and several days of intoxication were lost or enjoyed before I could descend to a cool and minute investigation.<span><sup id=\"fnref:55\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:55\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">55</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, when <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/509\" target=\"\\_blank\">Boswell</a> visited the Palatine hill with <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3436\" target=\"\\_blank\">Morison</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>We walked to where the house of Cicero had stood. A statue there resembles him a great deal. Struck by these famous places, I was seized with enthusiasm. I began to speak Latin. Mr. Morison replied. He laughed a bit at the beginning. But we made a resolution to speak Latin continually during this course of antiquities. We have persisted, and every day we speak with greater facility, so that we have harangued on Roman antiquities in the language of the Romans themselves.<span><sup id=\"fnref:56\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:56\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">56</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>Despite its playfulness, this episode illustrates the imaginative depth of the experience possible for tourists, even if <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/509\" target=\"\\_blank\">Boswell</a> had to lead his <em>cicerone</em>. Nonetheless, the professional guide—however changed since the eighteenth century—has become a fixture of modern travel, and that is the undeniable legacy of the <em>ciceroni</em> of the Grand Tour.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sYLwFqOfIlRu3bfxCbbYMZhVo_wGiiLdQ_BUEjwnrPw/edit#gid=1805869645\" target=\"\\_blank\">Download and explore the data behind this essay.</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3>References</h3>\n\n<div class=\"overlay\" id=\"popup\" style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column; flex-wrap: wrap; background: #f7f6f3\">\n    <div id=\"imgs\" style=\"height:80%\">\n        <div class=\"overlay-close\">\n            <a><i class=\"material-icons\">close</i></a>\n        </div>\n        <img id=\"img\" />\n        <img id=\"img2\" />\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"capWrapper\" style=\"height:20%\">\n        <p id=\"cap\" style=\"float:left; max-width:80%; position:relative; left:120px; display:inline-block\"></p>\n        <div style=\"display:inline-block; float: right\">\n            <div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column; position:relative; right:100px; top:20px\">\n                <i class=\"material-icons link-cite\" aria-label=\"Cite this image\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">format_quote</i>\n                <i class=\"material-icons link-copy\" aria-label=\"Copy link to this image\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">link</i>\n                <i class=\"material-icons\" aria-label=\"Download\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">arrow_downward</i>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nfunction zoom(obj, obj2, caption) {\n    var popup = document.getElementById(\"popup\");\n    popup.style.maxHeight = \"90%\";\n    popup.style.height = \"90%\"\n    var image = document.getElementById(\"img\");\n    var image2 = document.getElementById(\"img2\");\n        \n    image.src = obj.src;\n    image.style.display = \"block\";\n    image.style.marginLeft = \"auto\";\n    image.style.marginRight = \"auto\";\n    image.style.left = \"0\";\n    image.style.right = \"0\";\n    image.style.width = \"100%\";\n    image.style.height = \"100%\";\n    image.style.objectFit = \"contain\";\n\n    image2.style.display = \"none\"; // hide in case Fig 1 or 2 were clicked\n    document.getElementById(\"capWrapper\").style.width = image.offsetWidth;\n\n    if (obj2 != undefined && obj2 != null) { // Figure 1 & 2 are paired\n        image.style.float = \"left\";\n        image.style.width = \"50%\";\n\n        image2.src = obj2.src;\n        \n        image2.style.display = \"block\";\n        image2.style.marginLeft = \"auto\";\n        image2.style.marginRight = \"auto\";\n        image2.style.left = \"0\";\n        image2.style.right = \"0\";\n        image2.style.float = \"left\";\n        image2.style.width = \"50%\";\n        image2.style.height = \"100%\";\n        image2.style.objectFit = \"contain\";\n\n        document.getElementById(\"capWrapper\").style.width = image.offsetWidth + image2.offsetWidth; \n    }\n    var cap = document.getElementById(\"cap\");\n    if (caption != undefined && caption != null) {\n        cap.innerHTML = caption.innerHTML;\n        cap.style.display = \"block\";\n        cap.style.marginTop = \"20px\";\n    } else {\n        cap.style.display = \"none\";\n    }\n    var overlays = document.getElementsByClassName(\"overlay\");\n      for (overlay of overlays) {\n        overlay.classList.remove(\"visible\");\n      }\n    popup.classList.add(\"visible\"); \n}    \n</script>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>John Evelyn, <em>The Diary of John Evelyn</em>, edited by Esmond Samuel de Beer, 6 vols.

        "content"  : "<p>My interest in the Grand Tour explorer arises out of my own work on the engagement of British travelers with Italian cities during the long eighteenth century. Some years ago, I published a book that concentrated upon British experiences and representations of Italian cities during the long eighteenth century, Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c. 1690-1820.1 As an urban historian, I was less concerned with what was collected or purchased by travelers, or with their social networks, than with exploring how images of major Italian cities were constructed and considering their influence in British culture. Given the opportunity to work with the Grand Tour Explorer, I wanted to use it to pursue several questions.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Like many historians, years of immersion in the primary sources meant that I had an intuitive sense of evolving patterns of travel and the composition of the traveling body. However, I was unable to provide any rigorous quantifiable basis for my conclusions or generalizations. How far were my generalizations borne out by the evidence of the Explorer, while taking into account the complex nature of its data, which we know to be far from complete (see the introduction of the book)? What new light could the Explorer cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the Explorer tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body? The dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste, acquired and polished in Italy, exercised such a powerful influence upon Britain’s eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.2 But it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic grand tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out throughout my book was the increasing presence of both female travelers and travelers from beyond the landed elite over the course of the eighteenth century, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book: Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile: such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa and Leghorn.</p>\n"

Tolkien’s <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, “not all those who wander are lost.”<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Indeed, as the recent brouhaha over the “wanderlust gene” DRD4-7R testifies, travel is a constant of human experience inflected in myriad ways by history, literature, and life; from the Aboriginal Walkabout and the Homeric epics through the Jungian archetype of “the wanderer” to <em>Tripadvisor.com</em> and Ibiza stag parties.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>  People travel to eat, to learn, and to conquer. They travel in search of architectural inspiration, for reasons of health, and simply because destinations were “there,” in Edmund Hillary’s felicitous formulation. Within this swath of human history my interest lies with a particular <em>kind</em> of purposeful travel that I would define as “economic.” By this I do not mean frugal or “low cost,” or for that matter more permanent migration in search of a livelihood, but travel for the purpose of improving the management of the material world—theoretically or practically, individually or collectively; more the Jesuit François Xavier d’Entrecolles discovering the secrets of Chinese porcelain in 1712 than, say, Ryanair.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> Economic journeys are, by default, emulative in aspiration if not in practice, as they are driven by the desire to discover better ways of doing and thinking in the economic sphere—not to mention to establish commercial linkages and networks. Such travels represent a crucial vector of globalization both past and present.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In the wake of East Timor’s new independence in 2002, for example, future Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri embarked on a global tour of “relevant” countries, ranging from Singapore to Nauru to Norway, in order to “learn from their experiences” and choose which one to emulate as a model of national political economy.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> A decade later, the Wenzhou businessman Sun Jian decided to fly to Lagos, Nigeria, after having considered everything from Bangladesh to Uzbekistan, because he had heard of opportunities there for outsourcing of Chinese manufacturing.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> These leaders’ modes of travel, one informed by macro- and the other by micro-economic concerns, harken back to the origins of international commerce and communication itself; to the conceptual beginnings of what we today call globalization.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> Examples of such economic tours are bountiful, stretching back into the dimmest eons of recorded history; eighteenth-century Europe positively brimmed with them.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> Indeed, the mythical “Grand Tour” in early modern Europe, of which these forms of instructive travel represent a woefully neglected aspect, has come to be seen as one of the cardinal institutions of the Enlightenment.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Scholars have recently called for a broader analysis of the Grand Tour, including, among other things, the women and children, servants and middlemen, foreigners and Italians among whom wealthy young Britons travelled. Though I am principally interested in the role of travel in early modern political economy, this essay contributes to expanding the historical parameters of Grand Tourism.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> I have elsewhere explored how the theories and practices of countries that “forged ahead,” to quote the Stanford economist Moses Abramowitz, were emulated in Europe through the medium of translation. Relatedly, I would argue that another type of “Grand Tour” emerged in the eighteenth century, in which travelers visited countries of similar or more advanced economic development and geopolitical standing for both technological and governmental inspiration. To emulate, in short, foreign best practices.<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup> The exercise of collecting strategic intelligence abroad had, of course, been a primary task of spies and ambassadors in early modern Europe, but a broader and more diverse set of travelers came to carry out this activity over the course of the eighteenth century. As the statesman, intellectual, and future 117th Doge of Venice Marco Foscarini put it in a 1742 ambassadorial report from Turin, one of the primary purposes of such accounts had historically been not merely to record events, but to survey the trade networks, industries, and armies of different countries. Yet,</p>\n\n<blockquote>…as these became familiar with the passing of time, and common knowledge because of the new facility of travel, which rendered it more frequent, and because of the infinite number of published books comprehensively treating of these issues, one has, not without reason, abandoned this form of report over the past century and reduced it to a kind of particular history containing the maxims, councils, and arcane origins of the things that took place during the duration of any given Ambassadorship. <span><sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>The increasing frequency of travel, along with the exploding volume of publications in early modern Europe, changed the economy of intelligence on the continent, as a far wider spectrum of travelers and thinkers turned to questions of political economy and accumulated insights became common knowledge.<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup> Yet Foscarini insisted that travel could still offer strategic insights into the economic administration and economic systems of competing polities, even offering “perfect examples to imitate.”<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> Like textual translation, travel thus remained one of the early modern period’s principal vehicles of both international emulation and the standardization of best practices in the Western world, not to mention, in some cases, its transoceanic connections.<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> “The subject of Finances,” the future U.S. President John Adams mused, could be learned only “from books or from Travel.”<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup> For similar reasons, his fellow Founder and future President <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2667\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Jefferson</a> (1743-1826, travel year 1787) visited Piedmont in 1787 as part of his Grand Tour to study rice-growing practices. Like many contemporary traveling collectors, Jefferson acquired rare books in Italy, including a “copy of Polybius, the best edition,” but he readily admitted that</p>\n\n<blockquote>I scarcely got into classical ground… in architecture, painting, sculpture, I found much amusement; but more than all in their agriculture, many objects of which might be adopted with us to great advantage. <span><sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p>Though <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2667\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jefferson</a> indulged in many of the activities of the stereotypical Grand Tourist, his itinerary was fundamentally inflected by exigencies of political economy.</p>\n\n<p>Macro- and micro-economic interests sometimes overlapped during what one might call “Economic Grand Tours,” as was the case when the Milanese merchant and large-scale textile manufacturer Antonio Greppi traveled most of Europe not merely in search of business opportunities, but to familiarize himself with the theoretical study of international political economy.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup> Direct experience lent authority in economic affairs, as the Abruzzo adventurer Troiano Odazi proved when he successfully advertised his extensive travels when seeking a professorship in political economy at the University of Naples.<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup> The Germanic ideal of <em>Bildung</em> so essential to the Grand Tour was, after all, pursued for individual as well as societal ends.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup> Even the aesthetic language that Grand Tourists habitually employed to describe sublime vistas of Roman ruins and bucolic bliss found economic expression in some cases. When the Milanese patrician and scholar Alessandro Verri first visited England, for example, he marveled at the <em>bellissima veduta</em> not of Dover’s white cliffs but rather of London along the banks of the Thames, “covered with merchant ships, which form a forest of trees and another city on the sea.”<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> provides a remarkable tool for considering the continental experiences of travelers from what was by many accounts the world’s most advanced economy, Britain, as they ventured to Italy, a one-time seat of commercial power in Europe then in relative decline.<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> And yet, while the <em>Explorer</em> helps visualize and analyze the British Grand Tour to Italy in new ways, it also exemplifies some of the pitfalls of applying digital tools in the humanities. By mentioning this I do not intend to diminish the value of such scholarship, but rather to contribute to furthering the ways in which old scholarship and new technologies can interact and such digital projects can truly benefit the humanities.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> retains many of the cornucopian qualities of its source, <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy 1701-1800</em> (1997). The latter was the work of a large editorial team led by John Ingamells in order to engage with the vast personal archive of the British collector and art historian Sir Brinsley Ford.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup> The project of amassing the <em>Dictionary</em> was by necessity eclectic, even quixotic, but produced a unique treasure trove of information regarding the British Grand Tour to Italy in the age of Enlightenment; or, perhaps more appropriately, of contemporary British, Irish, and American travel to Italy. British visitors to Italy might or might not have made the list, depending on availability and convenience of materials, not to mention personal interest. They might be blessed with pages of text or relegated to cursory sentences (though it needs to be said that the <em>Dictionary</em> identified a <em>very</em> large number of even cursory travelers). Needless to say, the editorial team only recorded itineraries of which they were certain. This led to a number of travelers “teleporting” around Italy as evidenced through fleeting appearances of names and places in archival or published sources. No Grand Tourist could <em>only</em> have visited landlocked Florence in the eighteenth century, no matter how attractive its institutional reforms and relative development were to contemporary travelers.<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> It might even be argued that the <em>Dictionary</em> could only be so rich and varied because of what it neglected. As Orlando Pescetti put it in his <em>Proverbi italiani</em>, rendered famous by Voltaire, “the best is the enemy of the good.”<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> In this, the <em>Explorer</em> has walked a fine line, maintaining the <em>Dictionary</em>’s original underlying structures, while also making them more transparent and increasing accessibility to its rich content.</p>\n\n<p>Ford, Ingamells, and their collaborators did <em>not</em> plan on their work being transformed into an easily accessible database. This is clear when considering, for example, the defining terms with which many of the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entries begin, which the <em>Explorer</em> has organized in the category of “Employments and Identifiers.” Perhaps only a lone British “editor of Shakespeare” and a solitary “bear-leader” really ventured to Italian shores in the eighteenth century—though if one were to substitute “bear-leader” with the term “tutor” or “traveling tutor” the number swells to four—but it is hard to believe that only one solitary traveler was a “dilettante poet,” one an “amateur scientist,” and only one, rather implausibly, warranted the qualifier “miscreant.”<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> Ingamells cared first and foremost (one is tempted to say singularly) about what Ford had called “matters connected with the arts, patronage [and] collecting,” yet he called only one lonely voyager an “art critic”; boding poorly for subjects he cared for not at all.<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup> Similarly, though focusing on British travelers, even for the period following the War of Independence (1775-1783), he continued to list several Americans. And can we really be certain that <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/508\" target=\"\\_blank\">William Bosville</a> (1745-1813, travel year 1779) was the British Grand Tour’s <em>only</em> “bon vivant,” and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4536\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Hall Stevenson</a> (1718-85, travel year 1753) its token “hedonist,” rather than the other way around?<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup> The <em>Explorer</em> illustrates how the <em>Dictionary</em>’s categories were literary in many cases rather than simply analytical. It also shows how, in extrapolating data from a different medium, one risks codifying the tentative and impressionistic. Ingamells, after all, wished for the book to be “readable” and—somewhat lethally for an analytical database—to embrace “a certain variety of style.”<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup> To a scholar of the Grand Tour, the classification of the physician and tour-guide <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2321\" target=\"\\_blank\">Dr. James Hay</a> (d. 1746, travel years 1704-1706, 1707-1709, 1711-1712, 1715, 1718-1719, 1720, 1722-1723, 1729-1734) as “bear-leader,” for example, is a witty implicit reference to Pier Leone Ghezzi’s c. 1725 caricature “Dr. Hay as Bear-Leader” and the colloquial eighteenth-century nickname for a traveling tutor. But it also risks suggesting Hay was touring with actual bears—also an early modern practice—around the ruins of ancient Rome rather than wealthy British youths.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-1.png\" id=\"fig1\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1\">\n\n<b>Fig. 1:</b> Pier Leone Ghezzi, <i>Dr. Hay as Bear-Leader</i>, c. 1725, London, British Museum.

Its only “economist” was the Irish banker and writer <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/790\" target=\"\\_blank\">Richard Cantillon</a> (1680-1734, travel years 1724-1725); its “political economist” was Adam Smith’s nemesis <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4530\" target=\"\\_blank\">Sir James Steuart</a> (1712-1780, travel years -1739, 1758-); the lone “agricultural writer” Ingamells detected was <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4859\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jethro Tull</a> (1674-1741, travel years c.1711-14); and his “agriculturist” was <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/5281\" target=\"\\_blank\">Arthur Young</a> (1741-1820, travel year 1789).<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4664\" target=\"\\_blank\">John Symonds</a> (1730-1807, travel years 1765-1771), Regius Professor of Modern History in Cambridge for nearly four decades, was the only tourist identified as an “agronomist, and miscellaneous writer” in the <em>Dictionary</em>, though not a “historian” or, for that matter, a “lawyer,” which he also was.<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> The Welsh Major-General Henry Lloyd, one of the most Münchausen-like figures of his century, appeared both as “soldier and economist <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1638\" target=\"\\_blank\">Henry Humfrey [sic] Evans</a>” in Parma in 1769, and as the “mercenary, military historian” <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2984\" target=\"\\_blank\">Gen.

Moreover, the <em>Explorer</em> curates and adds new layers of navigation to the <em>Dictionary</em>’s text. The “Occupations and Posts” categories now group the professions and interests of travelers in more searchable forms. Still, as a digital transformation of the original text, the <em>Explorer</em>’s data remains, so far, largely dependent on the information contained in the <em>Dictionary</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, Ford, Ingamells, and their team <em>did</em> take note of merchants, to the extent that the second single largest category in “Employments and Identifiers” after “painter” (165 entries) is “merchant” (157 entries). And if one adds the sundry variations of the term—“textile merchant,” “timber merchant, “oriental merchant,” and “wine merchant”—as well as other “economic” occupations such as, in “Occupations and Posts,” “banker,” “merchant banker,” “financier,” and, of course, “money lender,” in this case the notorious <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2774\" target=\"\\_blank\">John “Jew” King</a> (1753-1823, travel years 1785-1823)—one can create a list of 180 such “economic” Grand Tourists reaching Italy from Britain during the period scrutinized by Ingamells; a similar number, incidentally, results from adding up the categories of “painter” (165), “portrait painter” (8), and “watercolourist” (4).<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> Both clusters are, in any case, limited compared to the 5,972 total entries in the <em>Explorer</em>, some of which were cross-referenced variations of names, but sizable in relation to the 914 travelers for whom Ingamells found “Employments and Identifiers,” or even the 2,020 that we end up with if we add those with identified “Occupations and Posts.” Adopting a bird’s eye view for the occasion, a map of all recorded travels of these individuals reveals a logical pattern.</p>\n\n<p>As a baseline of analysis, most Grand Tourists with an employment identifier, occupation or post visited Italian cities in the same order that the raw total did: Rome (1,371), distantly trailed by Florence (926) and Venice (812), then Naples (810), Turin (476), Leghorn (441), Padua (404), and Genoa (339), then a broad swath of locations from Trieste to Sicily. Many travelers reached Italy through France and the Alps, arriving at Savoy Turin. Genoa and Leghorn’s prominent places in the second tier of cities might also reflect geographical necessities of travel at the time (for more on this, see Rachel Midura’s essay in this collection). One can only assume that Milan would have ranked higher in an aggregate map of Grand Tourists from Northern Europe, and Trieste would be ranked higher in the case of travelers from the East.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-2\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-2.png\" id=\"fig2\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap2&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap2\">\n\n<b>Fig. 2:</b> Travels of Grand Tourists with “Employment or Identifier” and/or “Occupations and Posts” information.

Unsurprisingly, Rome (158 travelers) remains the premier destination on the Grand Tour, with Florence a distant second (68). These are followed by Naples (63) and Venice (43), closely trailed by Bologna (31) and Parma (27). Only around a third of these travelers voyaged south of Rome, and, of these, even fewer outside of Naples, though it is remarkable that more visited Naples than Venice. Though this would require sustained archival work to ascertain, it is tempting to guess that the trips by this subset to many of the smaller cities reflected wishes to visit specific places of beauty or artworks on display. As William Hazlitt so famously, if wrong-headedly, derided his countrymen, “the English abroad turn out of their way to visit every pettifogging, huckstering object that they can see better at home…”<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-3.png\" id=\"fig3\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap3\">\n\n<b>Fig. 3:</b> Travels of Grand Tourists with “Painter,” “Portrait Painter” or “Watercolourist” as the “Employment or Identifier.” Travels tended to feature the major cities of the traditional Grand Tour, but show a wider distribution outside of them.

The Eternal City has, for the first time, been supplanted as the premier destination by Leghorn (98), followed by Naples (45), Venice (34), and Rome (31). Destinations further south were generally neglected by the itineraries of such “economic” Grand Tourists, who focused squarely on the country’s center and north, with comparably high frequencies of visits to the old economic core of the peninsula from Turin down to Genoa, and through Milan to Venice. Strikingly, these travelers were far less likely to be recorded in smaller cities on the Grand Tour than were artists. As the Danish Cameralist Peter Christian Schumacher, who explicitly had set out on a Grand Tour to study European practices of political economy, justified his decision not to visit Naples, “it holds so little influence in the European system that it cannot be of particularly dire importance [<em>magtpaaliggende</em>] what system they have.”<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-4.png\" id=\"fig4\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap4&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\n<b>Fig. 4:</b> Travels of “economic” grand tourists (180), with “Employment or Identifier” related to finance and trade.

The former city-states of Northern Italy continued to play a role in the commerce of the continent throughout the eighteenth century, and Leghorn remained an important <em>entrepôt</em> throughout the period, particularly for British interests due to the prevalence of the Levant Company. Frequently the first port of call after London for ships heading East, and a “great pivot” for British trade in the Mediterranean, Leghorn had long established itself as the main “funnel” for Turkish trade with Britain, France, and the Netherlands.<sup id=\"fnref:38\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></sup> Leghorn held a unique place among Italian cities in the imagination of the Grand Tour for being clean, modern, and built for the living rather than the dead; a space of bustling trade rather than of towering ruins.<sup id=\"fnref:39\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></sup> Far more British merchants and sailors visited Leghorn than those identified in Ingamells’ <em>Dictionary</em>, of course (as observed by Simon Macdonald in this collection). But it remains interesting that the “Free Port” of Leghorn—recently the subject of long overdue scholarly attention in the English-speaking world—would play such an important role in the more traditional Grand Tour that was the primary focus of the <em>Dictionary</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:40\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2984\" target=\"\\_blank\">Henry Lloyd</a>’s version of the Grand Tour was, in many ways, characteristic of this kind of economic travel. Very much confined to the upper half of the Italian peninsula, his journeys were dictated by his career as an international spy and economic theorist, as well as by his friendship with members of the Milanese “Academy of Fisticuffs” (<em>Accademia dei pugni</em>), with whom he revolutionized the use of algebra and differential calculus in political economy.<sup id=\"fnref:41\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></sup> Lloyd traveled for reasons of international power politics and to learn about the science and discipline of political economy—itself repeatedly declared emblematic of the Enlightenment as such.<sup id=\"fnref:42\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-5.png\" id=\"fig5\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap5&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap5\">\n\n<b>Fig. 5:</b> Comparison of recorded travels of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2984\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Lloyd</a> (left, blue), <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/445\" target=\"_blank\">Sir Lambert Blackwell</a> (center, red) and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/459\" target=\"_blank\">Lewis Blaquiere</a> (right, green).

Though hardly evocative of the Grand Tour as commonly understood, Ingamells’ fleeting and melancholy mention of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/459\" target=\"\\_blank\">Lewis Blaquiere</a> (1722-1754, travel years 1744-1754) is also illustrative of countless other British merchants who escaped mention in the <em>Dictionary</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>BLAQUIERE, LEWIS (c.1722-54), merchant.<br />-1744-54 Leghorn.<br />With several other members of the British Factory at Leghorn, he signed a memorial in May 1744. He was presumably the Lewis Blaquiere who died in Leghorn on 3 August 1754, aged 32, and who was buried in the Protestant cemetery. <span><sup id=\"fnref:43\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></sup></span></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/459\" target=\"\\_blank\">Blaquiere</a> came to Leghorn on business and died there a decade later. Predictably, the map of Blaquiere’s Grand Tour matches perfectly those of a number of alphabetized “merchant” entries in the <em>Dictionary</em>, all the way down to <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/5243\" target=\"\\_blank\">Francis Wyatt</a> (travel year -1704), and presumably, numerous others.<sup id=\"fnref:44\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></sup> But, to quote my old friend U.S. Customs and Border Protection Declaration Form 6059B, “was the primary purpose of this trip business?”<sup id=\"fnref:45\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></sup> How relevant to the institution of the Grand Tour is Blaquiere’s resounding “yes” to this question? In the case of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2667\" target=\"\\_blank\">Jefferson</a>, his travels were clearly driven by purposes of both business and pleasure, and the idea of an “Economic Grand Tour” thus makes a certain degree of sense, but Blaquiere?</p>\n\n<p>Accepting John Brewer’s basic ideal of the Grand Tour as “an educational rite of passage,” often in preparation of “public duties,” an employee on the job abroad such as <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/459\" target=\"\\_blank\">Blaquiere</a> may actually have had more in common with his contemporary <em>milordi Inglesi</em> than one might first think.<sup id=\"fnref:46\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></sup> For there existed a venerable European tradition of merchants and tradesmen undergoing similar rites of passage on the road to acquire status in their professions. The British merchant stationed in Leghorn might not ultimately have been that different from a pre-revolutionary French journeyman, a stereotypical Hanseatic apprentice stuck in Bergen for a decade before returning home to a more important desk job, or, for that matter, a noble Christ Church graduate preparing for a position in British government.<sup id=\"fnref:47\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></sup> Inflections of this practice—quintessentially evident even in the aforementioned Aboriginal Walkabout—continue to characterize modern business and government institutions alike in large parts of the world.</p>\n\n<p>If we focus instead on the subset of 37 Grand Tourists in the “Occupations and Posts” category of “Finance and Trade,” the resulting map presents a different picture.  This subset includes the sort of powerful economic actors whom contemporaries began to call “capitalists,” such as <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2850\" target=\"\\_blank\">David Digues La Touche</a> (1729-1817, travel years 1753-1754, 1781, 1787-1793), the first Governor of the Bank of Ireland. Among these tourists, Rome (19 travelers) reclaims its throne, followed by Venice (15), Florence (14), and Leghorn (11). Not surprisingly, those who <em>did</em> venture South of Italy’s financial centers did so for the reason one might expect from historiography. La Touche, for example, seemingly traveled to Capua and Naples as a “collector,” rather than on business.<sup id=\"fnref:48\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:48\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Turning to the larger occupational subset of “Statesmen and Political Appointees” (884), the resulting map is in turn more reminiscent of the pattern revealed by the overall <em>Explorer</em> data. It seems improbable that only <em>one</em> of these travelers visited Pompeii, but, generally speaking, these numbers highlight the degree to which recent scholarship has exaggerated the importance of Naples relative to northern Italian cities as a destination for British travelers, and even more egregiously that of the rest of southern Italy. It remains striking that, at the moment of writing, the search for “eighteenth-century Naples” has 574 hits on Google Scholar, vastly overshadowing the equivalent searches for Florence (234), Genoa (52), Milan (178), Livorno (117; Leghorn has 2), and Turin (221), though all are dwarfed by Venice (1,450) and particularly Rome (1,990). A more specific search for “Grand Tour” in conjunction with the names of various cities is less informative, simply because most works on the Grand Tour mention a host of names somewhere in their texts, but the difference between Naples (8,580) and Leghorn (973) still serves to illustrate the divergence between historical travel and historiographical emphasis.<sup id=\"fnref:49\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:49\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-6\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-6.png\" id=\"fig6\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig7&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap67&apos;))\" /> </a> <a name=\"figure-7\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-7.png\" id=\"fig7\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig6&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap67&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap67\">\n\n<b>Fig. 6 and 7:</b> Travels of Grand Tourists included in the “Finance and Trade” (left) and “Statesmen &amp; Political Appointees” (right) categories by the <i>Explorer</i> designers in the “Occupations and Posts” Group.

In the eighteenth century, English books mentioned Naples more frequently than English travelers actually visited the city, based on the <em>Explorer</em>, particularly in comparison to other cities. Leghorn was more important to English trade and travel than the aggregate book history as channeled by a Google Ngram would suggest. If nothing else, these different perspectives on the Grand Tour made possible by digital history suggest more expansive approaches to different cities than have been traditionally employed.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-9\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-9.png\" id=\"fig9\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig10&apos;),\n getElementById(&apos;cap910&apos;))\" />\n </a> <a name=\"figure-10\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"reinert-figure-10.png\" id=\"fig10\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig9&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap910&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap910\">\n\n<b>Fig. 9 and 10:</b> Google Ngrams of mentions of select Italian cities in English publications, 1700-1800.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> supports the theory that economic travelers to Italy as a whole ventured to different places than those visited by the average traveler identified in the <em>Dictionary</em>, as well as those habitually emphasized by historians of the Grand Tour. Furthermore, it indicates a direction for more extensive archival work to answer the question of why, exactly, economically-interested individual British travelers chose particular destinations. Finally, the visualizations made possible by the use of digital tools suggest that significant historiographical revisionism is in order, as the center of gravity for British travelers to Italy matched the centers of economic activity on the peninsula far more closely than recent scholarship would suggest, even, as the aggregate data reveals, in the case of stereotypically aristocratic travelers seeking <em>Bildung</em> through exposure to the material remnants of antiquity.<sup id=\"fnref:52\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></sup> The Grand Tour was a protean institution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the shifting geography of which reflected changing spaces of cultural importance in Europe.<sup id=\"fnref:53\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:53\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></sup> Though the Enlightenment fervor for exoticism, antiquarianism, collecting, and bric-a-brac generally has been studied in recent decades, travel was also one of the most important vectors for worldlier processes of international commerce, communication, competition, and emulation at the time. The greatest difference between the traditional scholarly Grand Tour and its economic variation, however, might be that while the former looked to the past, the latter looked resolutely to the future, inventing rather than confirming established tropes.<sup id=\"fnref:54\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:54\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">54</a></sup> Journeying for business and political economy remains a vast, trans-historical phenomenon, of which the economic tourism traceable through the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> must be considered an important subset; the Grand Tour itself a particularly vibrant chapter in the timeless flow of goods, people, and ideas that forms our past and our present.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PK9HjOIVVbhW3W4EcCymgUUz-REeCKIZxa0oUJMr0NE/edit#gid=1084412681\" target=\"\\_blank\">Download and explore the data behind this essay.</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></p>\n\n<p>This paper was prepared as part of Giovanna Cesarani’s <em>Grand Tour Explorer Project</em>, and I am grateful to the participants at her Stanford conference of 4-5 March 2016 as well as to Steven L.

The 81 were identified by using the “Free word search” tool to locate entries containing “Rosalba” <i>or</i> “Carriera”. Close reading of the 81 entries was combined with information from additional sources to identify the types of association each traveler had with the artist, whether she appears in their correspondence or diaries, or they are known to have sat for a portrait by her or commissioned a piece of her artwork. The different types of association are indicated in different colors. This visualization gives a vivid impression of how many British travelers Carriera interacted with&#8212;and made portraits of&#8212;during her long career. Indeed, the <i>Explorer</i> data is almost certainly an undercount, due both to the vagaries of the historical record and to the particularities of the making of the <i>Dictionary</i> and its transformation into the virtual <i>Explorer</i>.

Her patrons included foreign collectors, artists, and members of the clergy, as well as fellow Venetians and other Italians. Royals across Europe sought her work: Frederick IV, King of Denmark; Johann Wilhelm von der Platz, Elector Palatine; and Frederick Augustus II, Prince-Elector of Saxony (also known as Augustus III, King of Poland), who amassed over one hundred pastels by Carriera for a gallery he dedicated to her in Dresden.<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Carriera’s studio, which she maintained in her home on the Grand Canal, was an important stop on the Grand Tour. Her clients sought portraits of themselves, depictions of various types of allegories, or portraits of Venetian women famous for their beauty or musical talent (<a href=\"#figure-23\">Figure 3</a>).<sup id=\"fnref:1:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-23\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sama-figure-23.png\" id=\"fig23\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap23&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap23\">\n\n<b>Figs. 2-3.

One of Carriera’s most ardent supporters was <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1035\" target=\"\\_blank\">Christian Cole</a> (fl. 1697-1735, travel years 1701-1705, 1707-1714, 1715), secretary to the <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3158\" target=\"\\_blank\">English Ambassador to Venice</a>. In a letter to the artist alerting her to the imminent arrival of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1833\" target=\"\\_blank\">Sir Thomas Frankland</a> (c. 1683-1747, travel years 1704-1705), Cole noted that his compatriot, “would not like to pass through Venice without seeing the Signora Rosalba [who is] justly esteemed an ornament of Italy, and [the] premier painter of Europe.”<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> When traveling through Venice British travelers also acted as couriers for the artist, ferrying letters, books, pastel chalks and works of art between Carriera and other friends and acquaintances; among these individuals who populate the <em>Explorer</em>, we can count Cole, Frankland, and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4868\" target=\"\\_blank\">Thomas Turner</a> (travel years 1704-1705). Still others—<a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2658\" target=\"\\_blank\">Peter Philip Jamineau</a> (travel years -1735-1745) and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4657\" target=\"\\_blank\">Owen Swiney</a> (1676-1754, travel years 1715-1732)—acted as agents for Carriera, negotiating commissions and arranging for payment and deliveries. In short, Carriera’s career was tightly bound to the transactional world of the Grand Tour, and British travelers collectively played a vital and multifaceted role in the artist’s work life.<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>I came to the <em>Grand Tour Explorer</em> as a scholar of Rosalba Carriera, whose correspondence I am currently co-translating and editing.<sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> With few exceptions (including <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1035\" target=\"\\_blank\">Cole</a>), British clients and acquaintances are mostly absent from this correspondence. I wondered what further information the <em>Explorer</em> could offer about the artist and her interactions with these individuals, beyond the connections already widely established by art historians. This seemed a particularly intriguing question because, as an Italian artist, Rosalba Carriera does not have an entry in the richly detailed <em>A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy</em>, compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells (1997). Consequently, information about Carriera cannot be found in one easily identifiable place; instead, references to her appear scattered throughout the entries of the <em>Dictionary</em>. The search power of the <em>Explorer</em> made it easy to gather these references: one inquiry using the “Free word search” tool with the terms “Rosalba” or “Carriera” elicited 81 entries—a promising start to a more detailed investigation. I decided to explore the database in tandem with Carriera’s correspondence, her work diary, and other primary sources to confirm or clarify details about her British clients and to see if I could discover new information. Pairing primary sources with the database’s digital search capability was powerful: in some cases it allowed me to trace connections between Carriera and British clients even when neither Carriera nor Venice were mentioned in the <em>Explorer</em>’s entries. In others, unexpected aggregations of travelers in the search results produced new questions and ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Searches of the database using specific dates and places also help identify individuals whose names are illegible in manuscript sources. For example, on 9 May 1724 Carriera recorded in her work diary the visit to her studio of a “M.r Felo inglese” (<a href=\"#figure-3\">Figure 3</a>). A quick search of the <em>Explorer</em> using “Venice” and this specific date reveals that the British traveler <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1683\" target=\"\\_blank\">Coulson Fellowes</a> (1696-1769, travel year 1724), was in and around Venice at this time. Even though Carriera is not mentioned in Fellowes’ entry and despite the fact that his name is difficult to decipher in the primary source, we can confirm his identity.

The entry for 9 May 1724 notes a visit from a “M.r Felo inglese.” By searching the <i>Explorer</i> for that date and “Venice” (the location of Carriera’s studio), it was possible to quickly identify the individual as Coulson Fellowes, a British Grand Tourist. The searchability of Grand Tour data enabled by the <i>Explorer</i> makes discoveries such as this much faster than before. Ashburnham 1781, 5, c. 62r.\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>In this essay I share my experience using the <em>Explorer</em> in order to investigate two specific aspects of Carriera’s life and work: first, her connections with other women, and second, her studio as a physical and social space. In so doing, I also aim to provide a vademecum of sorts for anyone wishing to navigate the expansive territories of the <em>Explorer</em>, particularly for those whose research focuses on the Italians or other Europeans with whom the British travelers interacted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rosalba Carriera</strong></p>\n\n<p>Little is known about Carriera’s early life and artistic training.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> Most women who became successful artists had fathers, brothers or husbands who were also artists. This was not the case for Carriera: her father worked as a government office clerk, she had no brothers, and she never married. She maintained her own studio where her sisters Giovanna and Angela (until the latter’s marriage) worked as assistants and collaborators. After their father’s death, Rosalba—aged 46—became the head of the family household, continuing to live with and support her mother and younger sister Giovanna for the rest of their lives.</p>\n\n<p>By her late twenties, the Venetian artist began to make a name for herself throughout Europe. She received invitations to courts across Europe and left the lagoon city for three extended trips. The most important of these was an invitation to Paris, where she lived for a year (1720-21) with her mother and sisters in the home of the financier and collector, Pierre Crozat. Much admired by fellow artists as well as royalty, she counted among her numerous clients Antoine Watteau and the young Louis XV. Back in Italy, two years later, in 1723, she was invited to the court of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, where she lived for about five months while she created portraits of the princesses of the Este family. In 1730, she travelled with her sister, Giovanna, to the court in Vienna where she worked for about three months, creating portraits of various members of the court, including the Dowager Empress Wilhelmina Amalia.</p>\n\n<p>Carriera’s talent was rewarded by special admission to academies of art in Italy and France, despite their regulations barring female members. In 1705, she was admitted to the Academy of St. Luke in Rome as a meritorious member—rather than as a mere “honorary” member, as was typical for most women admitted to art academies.<sup id=\"fnref:7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> In 1720 she became a member of two other academies: the Clementine Academy in Bologna and the prestigious Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Paris.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout her life, Carriera worked assiduously. She was an astute businesswoman, earned a good living, and invested her savings; she was frequently able to lend money to family members and friends in need. She also dedicated time to female apprentices; one of them, Felicita Sartori (1715-1760), lived and worked in the Carriera home/studio for over 30 years and made a name for herself as a miniaturist, pastellist and engraver. Carriera worked into her early seventies—undergoing surgeries for cataracts, only partially successful, until blindness forced her to stop.<sup id=\"fnref:8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><strong>Miniatures and Pastels</strong></p>\n\n<p>Early in her career, Carriera was renowned for her delicate miniature portraits and allegories in tempera, watercolor, or gouache on an ivory ground. She helped raise the status of miniature painting to a fine art by removing it from the purely decorative realm of snuff boxes. She was one of the first artists in Europe to bring the feel and texture of large paintings to the miniature form, and her innovative techniques influenced the evolution of the art of miniature painting over the course of the eighteenth century.<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> At first Carriera used the ivory bottoms or tops of snuff boxes (no longer attached or functioning as such) for her miniatures, but eventually she began to purchase small pieces of ivory and have them cut to size, usually in a vertical oval form. She covered her miniatures with glass and mounted them in metal or tortoiseshell cases before sending them to her clients, who could display them in cabinets, keep them in coat pockets, or hang them from ribbons around their necks.

Indeed, about three-quarters of the roughly 440 works attributed to her are pastels.<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> The Venetian artist helped transform pastel chalks from something used mostly for preliminary sketches to a respected and popular medium for portraiture. French and Italian artists who admired and were influenced by Carriera include Charles-Antoine Coypel, Maurice Quentin de LaTour, Giovanna Fratellini, Jean-Baptiste Perroneau, Pietro Rotari, Nicolas Vleughels and Antoine Watteau.

This strategy was highly successful with Grand Tourists who specifically requested pictures depicting mythological figures, allegorical figures or portraits of beautiful Venetian women as well as portraits of themselves. Her sets of the Four Seasons and the Four Elements were very popular, as were her renditions of Diana and Flora.<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></sup> <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1405\" target=\"\\_blank\">Robert Dingley</a> (1710-81, travel years 1733-34), collector and future director of the Bank of England, wrote to Carriera from London in 1735, requesting a picture of a “pretty young country girl” in the guise of Winter, specifically “like the one in the cabinet of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4417\" target=\"\\_blank\">Mr. (Joseph) Smith</a>” (c. 1674-1770, travel years c. 1700-1770). It is likely that Dingley had noticed this picture during his Italian tour in the personal collection of Smith, who spent most of his life in Venice as a merchant banker and as the British Consul from 1744 to 1760. Dingley hastened to add that there was “no need to say anything to Mr. Smith about this.”<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></sup> His letter reveals how Carriera at times needed to deftly and discreetly serve the ambitions of multiple, competitive British clients.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1012\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sama-figure-1012.png\" id=\"fig1012\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1012&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap1012\">\n\n<b>Figs. 10-12.

Her miniatures’ tiny sizes (ranging from c. 7x5cm to 15x10cm) meant they were easy to wear, carry or send by post. Carriera’s pastels did not need the extensive drying time of oil paintings, and their generally moderate size (ranging from 30x25 to 70x50 cm) made them relatively easy to ship or, ideally, have hand delivered through couriers and friends traveling to other cities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exploring the Grand Tour Explorer: Carriera’s connections with other women</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most of the travelers that emerge from searching for Carriera in the <em>Explorer</em> are already known to scholars of the British Grand Tour. But the search results produce new groupings among her British interlocutors—leveling famous with less well-known clients, acquaintances with friends, intermediaries with visitors to her studio. They therefore offer us a uniquely nuanced and textured view of Carriera’s Grand Tour connections.</p>\n\n<p>One way I attempted to harness the powers of the Explorer was to tap it for information regarding Rosalba Carriera’s connections with other women. By using the “Free word search” term and filtering for gender with search terms such as woman, wife, widow, daughter, Mrs., etc. the database led me to two women: <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/621.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Elizabeth Eaton Broughton</a> (d. 1734, travel years 1691-1734) whom we hear about through the <em>Dictionary</em>’s entry on her husband, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/621\" target=\"\\_blank\">Hugh Broughton</a>, British Consul of Venice (d. 1716, travel years -1691-1716); and the pastellist, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4047\" target=\"\\_blank\">Katherine Read</a>, sometimes referred to by contemporaries as “the present English Rosalba”<sup id=\"fnref:14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> and one of the few women with her own entry in the original <em>Dictionary</em>. I was already familiar with Broughton and Read because of their (spare) presence in the Carriera correspondence. However, because the <em>Explorer</em> search aggregated them into a single result, I noticed that they both highlighted difficulties Carriera experienced in working with the impresario <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4657\" target=\"\\_blank\">Owen Swiney</a>, who acted as agent and intermediary between the artist and her British clients, handling commissions, deliveries and payments.<sup id=\"fnref:15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></sup> I was therefore able to look at these women in a new way, appreciating their role as sources of information on Carriera as a businesswoman, and considering further the artist’s place in a network of supportive women.<sup id=\"fnref:16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Unlike many of the travelers in the <em>Explorer</em> database, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/621.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Elizabeth Eaton Broughton</a> was a long-term resident in Venice. From 1690 to 1716 she lived there in her role as wife of the <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/621\" target=\"\\_blank\">British Consul</a>. After her husband’s passing, she remained in the lagoon city (or at least sojourned there) until her own death nearly twenty years later in 1734.<sup id=\"fnref:17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></sup> The two extant letters Broughton wrote to Carriera indicate that she was a close friend of the artist and her family, and that she interacted with them in both English and Italian. One of the letters reflects a quotidian familiarity between the two women; in it, Broughton extends an invitation to Carriera’s sister Angela for a “country gallop a satterday in y.e afternoon” in Mestre, should weather permit such an outing.<sup id=\"fnref:18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/621.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Broughton</a> penned the other letter (in Italian) in 1721 soon after Carriera returned to Venice following the artist’s year away in Paris. Perhaps in part because Carriera was still re-inserting herself into life and work in Venice, Broughton wrote in order to relay confidential information about current gossip regarding payments for Carriera’s paintings: “My dear friend, since <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4657\" target=\"\\_blank\">Mr. Sueniy</a> has let all our compatriots know that he isn’t giving more than 15 sequins for the Portrait you made of Milord, I thought it a good idea to warn you, so that you can act accordingly and make sure you are well paid for the one of Mr. Ratley, and have no other regard than your own interest.” After penning the closing salutation, Broughton made sure to add, “I send this for your information and all of it must remain between us.”<sup id=\"fnref:19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></sup> Although Carriera’s work diary—the principal source we have of payments received—is silent at the time Broughton penned this letter, we know that between 1723 and 1728, the artist charged roughly 22 sequins for a large pastel portrait. We also know that her prices generally remained consistent throughout her career. Furthermore, Broughton—a well-informed and well-connected member of British grand tourist circles—clearly indicates that she thought Swiney was promoting insufficient remuneration of the artist.<sup id=\"fnref:20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Thirty-odd years later in 1753, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4047\" target=\"\\_blank\">Katherine Read</a> wrote to Carriera from Paris, after having recently visited the 80-year old Venetian artist in her studio and made her portrait. She noted that she was taking great pleasure in viewing works by Carriera at the Académy Royale de Peinture and in private collections. Since she was about to return to London, she asked if she might be of service regarding some (unidentified) business with <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4657\" target=\"\\_blank\">Swiney</a>. The impresario-agent appears at the center of the next extant letter from Read, which she wrote after hearing from Carriera for the first time in a year. The lack of communication, and a rumor of the artist’s death, had previously led Read to mourn Carriera as “a friend and an artist without equal who had brought greater honor to her sex than had ever been done before.”<sup id=\"fnref:21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></sup> This letter reveals that Read has been trying for nearly two years to help Carriera and Consul <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4417\" target=\"\\_blank\">Joseph Smith</a> (in whose care Read had previously sent letters to Carriera) receive money owed to them by the recently deceased Swiney. She had even consulted a friend who had transcribed a copy of Swiney’s last wishes and she was told that the impresario had left everything to “Mademoiselle Woffington”<sup id=\"fnref:22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></sup> who, in turn, told Read that just before his death, Swiney claimed he owed the Venetian artist nothing. Read explains all of this to Carriera in her letter, saying that she hopes “with all my heart that you can recover your money,” but she is not optimistic.<sup id=\"fnref:23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The younger artist concludes her letter expressing her desire to purchase one of Carriera’s works: a Madonna “which I think I heard was your last work” or a Cleopatra, “or another of your finest ideal heads,” whichever the artist would prefer to part with. She tells Carriera that she will pay whatever the artist wishes, and with her closing line she promises that she “will be more punctual than <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4657\" target=\"\\_blank\">Swinnie</a>.”<sup id=\"fnref:24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></sup> Clearly, Carriera was still conducting business despite her blindness and advanced age, and British travelers were still active participants in her professional life.</p>\n\n<p>The letters of <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/621.1\" target=\"\\_blank\">Broughton</a> and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4047\" target=\"\\_blank\">Read</a> give us a brief behind-the-scenes look into the ways friends, artists, patrons and agents navigated the waters of producing and selling art. Like the letter mentioned above from <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1405\" target=\"\\_blank\">Robert Dingley</a> to Carriera, these missives also reflect the highly interconnected and at times secretive social networking among British travelers to Italy. When considered together, the three letters allow us to consider how Carriera interacted with that network as a businesswoman. Were Broughton and Read writing to her simply as supportive friends? Or were they also writing as women seeking to protect another woman (artist) from being exploited by a man like <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4657\" target=\"\\_blank\">Swiney</a>, who could manipulate the art market in British circles? Regretfully, if Carriera penned responses to these letters, they are lost to us, so we can only speculate about what her thoughts might have been. Nevertheless, it is clear that the artist gained important information from women such as Broughton and Read. Ultimately, as Carriera’s correspondence reveals, her business could both benefit and suffer from the close connections and maneuverings in the circles of British travelers to Italy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Into the studio</strong></p>\n\n<p>What might the <em>Explorer</em> be able to tell us about Carriera’s studio? The richest source of information on the physical layout and contents of the studio is the inventory of Carriera’s belongings after her death.<sup id=\"fnref:25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></sup> We thus know that when visitors entered the gallery area of the artist’s studio, they would have stepped into a large, comfortable, vibrant space decorated with green wallpaper and gilt-framed mirrors. The room was populated by numerous chairs upholstered in green damask, small Chinoiserie tables and a small clock set on a pedestal. At the ready were sets of porcelain cups and saucers for hot chocolate and coffee. In winter, visitors could warm themselves by the fireplace as they studied the paintings on display: the inventory notes twenty pastels and seven oil paintings in the gallery in addition to numerous other works of art in the central corridor (<a href=\"#figure-13\">Figure 13</a>).</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-13\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sama-figure-13.jpg\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap13&apos;))\" /> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap13\">\n\n<b>Fig. 13:</b> An excerpt from the inventory that was made of Rosalba Carriera’s studio following her death.

I was, therefore, looking for first-hand descriptions by Grand Tourists of their visits to the studio, something I could do efficiently because the database includes excerpts from travelers’ letters and journals. I created search term combinations such as “Carriera”/“Rosalba” combined with words and phrases such as: “studio,” “sat to,” “sitting,” “miniature,” “pastel,” “portrait,” “likeness,” “draw,” “paint,” “chalk,” “studio,” “mask,” etc. These searches resulted in, among others, three entries for <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4366\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Sinclair</a> (after 1714-1776, travel years 1737-1738), <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1760\" target=\"\\_blank\">Martin Folkes</a> (1690-1754, travel years 1733-1735) and <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/368\" target=\"\\_blank\">Willem (or William) Bentinck</a> (1704-1774, travel years 1727-1728). The <em>Explorer</em> search results pushed me to consider the three entries together as a group. The result is that we are granted a more vibrant and nuanced picture of life inside Carriera’s studio from the traveler’s vantage point.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors frequently remarked that Carriera had portraits of their compatriots on display in her studio. When <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4366\" target=\"\\_blank\">George Sinclair</a> visited the artist in the spring of 1738, he noted in his travel journal that he “saw many of her Portraits, both men and women, several english [sic] among them.” Keeping these likenesses about the studio was surely Carriera’s strategy not only to exhibit her talent but also to induce visitors to have their own portraits made by the famous artist’s hand. In this way, she promoted the notion that possession of her artworks was a benchmark of social success.</p>\n\n<p>The display of such portraits also served a social function in the life of the studio. <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1760\" target=\"\\_blank\">Martin Folkes</a>—scientist, antiquary and protégé of Isaac Newton—visited Carriera in the summer of 1733 as part of his travels in Italy. In his journal on 14 July, he noted that the artist’s “pictures in crayon have been with Justice esteem[e]d the most excellent pieces of art of that sort.”<sup id=\"fnref:26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></sup> He described the artist as “now better than 50” (she was 60 years old) and declared that during his visit to the studio he was “extremely well entertained with a great number of fine portraits some of my acquaintance very like.” Folkes also mentioned seeing an Allegory of Music in the studio, which he declared to be “as fine and well disposed as almost anyth[ing] I have seen.” He believes the model for the painting was the lover of an Englishman.<sup id=\"fnref:27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Whether or not visitors commissioned a work by Carriera, then, it could please and amuse them to find their acquaintances visually present in the studio along with them. By functioning as “virtual” companions and as conversation pieces, the portraits enhanced the level of sociability in Carriera’s studio by encouraging sitters and guests to feel at ease and engaged. Although the excerpt is not included in the <em>Explorer</em> entry, <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1760\" target=\"\\_blank\">Folkes</a>’ journal supplies us with further information about social life in the studio. Folkes noted that all three Carriera sisters were present during his visit—Rosalba, Giovanna and Angela—and he remarked that the latter expressed “a great regard” for England, since she had sojourned there with her husband, the artist Antonio Pellegrini.<sup id=\"fnref:28\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></sup> Not only did Angela and especially Giovanna work in the studio; they also engaged in professional networking by participating in social gatherings with visitors and potential clients.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> entry on Anglo-Dutch traveler and statesman <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/368\" target=\"\\_blank\">Willem (or William) Bentinck (van Rhoon)</a> is especially rich regarding Carriera’s studio.<sup id=\"fnref:29\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></sup> Excerpts from Bentinck’s and from his tutor’s letters to family in England offer what may be the most detailed account that we have of a client sitting to Carriera. In 1727, as part of a two-year tour of Europe, the grand tourist and his tutor <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/389\" target=\"\\_blank\">Moses Bernège</a> (travel years 1717-1728, 1730-1731) spent three weeks in Venice. Just prior to their arrival in Venice, they had seen and admired Carriera’s portraits of King Augustus in Dresden. Bentinck sat to Carriera, intending the portrait to be a gift for his mother, the Dowager Countess of Portland. Bernège’s letter to the Countess discloses that when Bentinck arrived for the fifth and final sitting, “Rosalba chastised him roundly” for having cut his hair.<sup id=\"fnref:30\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></sup> In Bernège’s account the artist was so frustrated at the change in her client’s appearance from his previous sittings that she demanded that he complete the portrait himself by drawing in his hair the way it was before he had cut it. This image of an impatient Carriera is echoed in her correspondence where she occasionally bemoans the fact that she must spend time making portraits of so many <em>inglesi</em> that she cannot get to her other commissions, even for important, royal patrons.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Explorer</em> search results prompted me to take a closer look at the <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/389\" target=\"\\_blank\">Bernège</a>/<a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/368\" target=\"\\_blank\">Bentinck</a> papers directly.<sup id=\"fnref:31\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></sup> Many of Carriera’s European contacts and clients populate these letters: from couriers and middlemen to clergy, royalty and artists. Details in the manuscripts that are not included in the database allowed me to add further dimension to our view into Carriera’s studio. In contrast to his tutor’s version of events, Bentinck’s is far more peaceable, implying that it had been a collaborative and even thoughtful idea for him to draw in his own hair, specifically in order to ensure that his mother not be startled by any change in his appearance. As he relates the experience: “But as you remember me with my hair, which was cut off before the Picture was made, that must have made some alteration in the Physio[g]nomy. Yet to prevent that as much as possible and to hide the cutting of my hair, which I did not think you knew, Rosalba gave me her colours, and all the hair upon the forehead, and close to the face are of my own painting, as much as I could remember my hair had been.”<sup id=\"fnref:32\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></sup> Frequently eager to please and assuage his mother in his letters, Bentinck is keen to assure her that the portrait was indeed a good likeness, as “it was thought like by those that saw it at Venice, before I sent it.”<sup id=\"fnref:33\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></sup> In fact, son and tutor consistently offer conflicting views of the visit. While Bentinck assures his mother that his portrait “will always be worth something,” his tutor notes that there were portraits hanging in Carriera’s studio that were “strong likenesses,” and that Bentinck’s, while good, would have been better had he not cut his hair. Bernège also implies that his ward may have squandered his opportunity for acquiring a fine portrait by Carriera, commenting tersely that “she will stop working very soon as she is starting to become quite aged.”<sup id=\"fnref:34\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></sup> Carriera would go on to work for over two more decades.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/368\" target=\"\\_blank\">Bentinck</a>/<a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/389\" target=\"\\_blank\">Bernège</a> papers also highlight the dangers inherent in shipping works of art and other memorabilia acquired on the Grand Tour: namely, damage and theft. Bentinck’s instructions to the Dowager Countess reflect the attention Carriera gave to protecting her works from damage in transit, a theme that appears frequently in her correspondence. He tells his mother that the portrait will arrive “in a little black frame with a glass over it and must be left so, she [Carriera] herself desired me that it might be left just as it is because taking it out might easily spoil the Picture, and nothing moist must come near it.”<sup id=\"fnref:35\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></sup> In a subsequent letter, Bernège expresses relief in the knowledge that Carriera’s portrait arrived safely in England “because there was reason to fear that the ship had been commandeered by pirates and taken to Spain. The loss of the portrait would have deeply saddened us.”<sup id=\"fnref:36\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:36\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/368\" target=\"\\_blank\">Bentinck</a>/<a href=\"https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/389\" target=\"\\_blank\">Bernège</a> correspondence is also of interest because it may challenge the oft-quoted notion that the creation of pastel portraits was a quick affair, especially when compared to portraits in oil, which required extensive time to dry. Bernège reported that “Madame Rosalba took great care to do it, and requested several visits of Monsieur Bentinck so she could be as successful as possible.”<sup id=\"fnref:37\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></sup> Perhaps pastel portraits did take longer than is usually assumed if Carriera typically had her clients sit to her several times for one portrait.</p>\n\n<p>As we have seen in the case with Rosalba Carriera, navigating the <em>Explorer</em> in combination with primary sources is an effective and engaging way to build a more nuanced map of the connections between British Grand Tourists and their Italian contemporaries. In diverse ways, the <em>Explorer</em> exemplifies the best of digital humanities resources. Its accessibility online makes it a resource not only for scholars, but for any interested reader, regardless of one’s knowledge about the world of the Grand Tour. Scholars interacting with the database can design and employ diverse combinations of searches and filters for efficient and precise targeting of information. Finally, one of the <em>Explorer</em>’s most important features is the way that its search power puts seemingly unrelated pieces of information (some familiar, some not) into dialogue with one another, leading to new perspectives, questions and ideas.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ex2B4Int9NgSkkf8kQ8vKCSATOKxR0UBdB4yzlkJ8I/edit#gid=0\" target=\"\\_blank\">Download and explore the data behind this essay.</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3>Bibliography</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Primary Sources</strong></p>\n\n<p>Letters to the Countess Dowager of Portland from her sons, William and Charles Bentinck, and their tutors; 1718-31.

One of the themes that I had tried to draw out throughout my book was the increasing presence of both female travelers and travelers from beyond the landed elite over the course of the eighteenth century, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book: Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile: such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa and Leghorn.</p>\n"

How far were my generalizations borne out by the evidence of the *Explorer*, while taking into account the complex nature of its data, which we know to be far from complete (see Introduction)? What new light could the *Explorer* cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the *Explorer* tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body?\n\nThe dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste---acquired and polished in Italy---exercised such a powerful influence upon Britain's eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.[^2] But it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic Grand Tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out in my book was the increasing presence over the course of the eighteenth century of both female travelers and of travelers from beyond the landed elite, and the *Explorer* provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book---Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice---I was interested to see what light the *Explorer* might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile, such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa, and Leghorn.\n\n[^2]: Bruce Redford, *Venice and the Grand Tour* (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996). See also John Brewer \"Whose Grand Tour?\" in María Dolores Sánchez-Jáuregui and Scott Wilcox, eds., *The English Prize: The Capture of the Westmorland, an Episode of the Grand Tour* (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012), pp. 45-61, for expanding the scope beyond the \"typical\" Grand Tourists.\n\nMy initial approach was very basic: simply looking at patterns of travel and the relative popularity (in terms of numbers of visitors, rather than length of stay) of individual cities. Figures 1 and 2 show the number of travelers to individual cities by decade; [Figure 1](#figure-1) shows the five most popular cities; [Figure 2](#figure-2) shows the ten most popular cities.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-1\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"sweet-figure-1.svg\" id=\"fig1\" onload=\"resize(this, getElementById(&apos;fig2&apos;))\" onclick=\"zoom(this, getElementById(&apos;fig2&apos;), getElementById(&apos;cap12&apos;))\"/> </a> <a name=\"figure-2\" class=\"half-fig\"> <img src=\"sweet-figure-2.svg\" id=\"fig2\" onclick=\"zoom(getElementById(&apos;fig1&apos;), this, getElementById(&apos;cap12&apos;))\"/> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap12\">\n\n<b>Fig. 1 and 2:</b> Bar and line graphs charting the numbers of travelers by start year of travel to selected cities. The top five cities bear out many known patterns, however the addition of the next five cities complicates the picture of rising and falling traveler numbers. Note that the number of travelers has been aggregated by decade. This has been done for readability, as absent data prevents perfect continuous representation by individual year. (For another strategy, see the use of a moving average trend-line in <a href=\"/gt-book/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel Midura's essay</a>.)\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe data helps to clarify what most of us who have studied the Grand Tour without engaging in any quantitative analysis knew anyway: that travel declined in times of war---most strikingly in the 1740s during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748), and to a lesser extent during the American War of Independence (1775-1783); that Naples was increasingly popular as a destination in the latter half of the century, and that Rome was the most frequented city by some margin. The data also confirms that numbers of travelers increased significantly after the Peace of Paris (1763), and that travel did not immediately stop following the outbreak of the French Revolution (1789). Beyond the main four cities (and initially Padua), cities such as Bologna, Genoa, and Milan showed more or less the same pattern: a small but steady increase in numbers, particularly after 1760, until a stabilization or decline at the very end of the century. Although new areas were added to the tour of Italy---notably south of Naples in the later eighteenth century---Padua was the only destination which saw a clear decline in significance in the itineraries of British travelers over the course of the eighteenth century.\n\nThe dominance of Naples over Florence in the last two decades of the century is a striking feature. Again, one might have inferred this from the comments of visitors in journals, letters and topographical literature: enthusiasm for Naples and the warm south was growing while anxiety about its dangers and licentiousness diminished, whereas the charms of Florence were felt more keenly earlier in the century. Meanwhile, the rediscovery of medieval and early Renaissance Florence---the version of the city which so charmed the Victorians---had yet to be made.[^3] Similarly, although Venice was always one of the most important destinations of the Italian tour, the data suggests that it was overtaken in popularity by Florence and Naples during the second half of the century until the last decade. There are a number of reasons why this might have been the case: first and most pragmatically, while both Florence and Naples were centers where British tourists were happy to reside for weeks or even months, Venice was a city through which visitors passed much more swiftly, seldom spending more than a week or two. There is therefore a higher chance that visits went unrecorded. The relative downward trend in Venice's appeal is borne out by more qualitative comments, the tenor of which showed increasing awareness of Venice's decline and a greater inclination to find fault with the city's appearance, its society, and its virtue. In the 1790s, however, when visitor numbers in other cities were falling, numbers in Venice (and to a lesser extent to Padua) increased: a shift that reflects the geopolitics of the time as travelers were funneled out of Italy through the Austrian Tyrol, rather than through enemy France.[^4]\n\n[^3]: On attitudes towards and relative popularity of the different cities see Sweet, *Cities and the Grand Tour*, chapters 2-5.\n\n[^4]: For more on shifts in transalpine travel, see the essay by Rachel Midura.\n\nThe most striking point, however, is the dominance of Padua in the early eighteenth century. Indeed, during the first decade of the eighteenth century we know of more travelers in Padua than in any other city, Rome included. In the second decade the number was equal to those in Rome, by the third decade Padua appears to have been losing its dominance, and by mid-century it had become, apparently, a relatively unimportant destination on the British Grand Tour. In general terms, this broad outline bears out what we know already: the reputation of Padua's medieval university was in decline during the eighteenth century; it was not a contemporary hub of major artistic or cultural production, nor was it a political or religious center.\n\nBeyond that, this data highlights one of the problems with the archival base of *A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy*, compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells (1997), which is carried over in the *Explorer*. A key source for the compilers of the *Dictionary* was the register of matriculation at the [University in Padua](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/search/%7B%22entry%22:%7B%22terms%22:%5B%7B%22value%22:%22university%20of%20padua%22,%22beginning%22:true,%22end%22:true%7D%5D,%22sections%22:%5B%7B%22key%22:%22biography%22,%22name%22:%22Biography%22,%22checked%22:true,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12578%22%7D,%7B%22key%22:%22narrative%22,%22name%22:%22Narrative%22,%22checked%22:true,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12579%22%7D,%7B%22key%22:%22tours%22,%22name%22:%22Tours%22,%22checked%22:true,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12580%22%7D,%7B%22key%22:%22notes%22,%22name%22:%22Notes%22,%22checked%22:true,%22$$hashKey%22:%22object:12581%22%7D%5D,%22operator%22:%22or%22%7D%7D){:target=\"\\_blank\"}, which visitors in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries made a point of signing.[^5] As Ingamells explained in his introduction to the *Dictionary*, this source allowed the compilers of the *Dictionary* to document visitors passing through Padua early in the century more completely than for most other cities. However, the declining numbers that we see from the 1730s also correspond with a decline in the practice of signing the register: the last signature was recorded in 1765.[^6] This does not mean that visitors were no longer passing through the city; simply that there was no longer a single source of evidence to verify their presence; the reliability of the *Dictionary* in noting visits to lesser cities---the cities where visitors spent a matter of days rather than weeks---is less consistent.\n\nThis also reflects the interests of those compiling the *Dictionary*, whose agenda was the history of art and collecting, as well as the examination of the social networks of those who were engaged in shaping taste and exercising patronage. The experience of travel per se was not their driving concern. For example, the visit to Padua by the Norwich merchant [Robert Harvey](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2294){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1753-1820, travel year 1773, GTE 2294) was undocumented in the *Dictionary*; however, his journal records that he became stuck in the mud outside Padua and spent the following day wandering around \"this large, straggling, ill built, ancient city with arcades said to have been built by Antenor, whose tomb they pretend to show you.\"[^7] Yet the entry in the *Dictionary* has him proceeding from Rome to Venice, in common with many other entries, with no mention of any of the intervening cities.\n\n[^5]: Horatio F. Brown, *Inglesi e Scozzesi all' Università di Padova dall' anno 1618 sino al 1765* (Venice, 1921).\n\n[^6]: Ingamells, *Dictionary*, p. x.\n\n[^7]: Norfolk Record Office MS 20677 Journal of Robert Harvey, entry for 26 Oct. 1773 (p. 210).\n\nNumbers of visitors to all cities increased in the 1760s, but the spike for Turin is particularly noticeable; moreover, the increase was not sustained subsequently whereas in other cities numbers of visitors continued on an upward trend. The pattern becomes clearer if we look at Turin in isolation ([Figure 3](#figure-3)).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sweet-figure-3.svg\"  onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap3&apos;))\"/> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap3\">\n\n<b>Fig. 3:</b> Number of travelers as counted by start year of travel to Turin. The graph shows the anomalous spike in numbers of travelers between 1761-1770.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nTurin's geographical situation ensured its importance as a center for travelers, being the first major city for those who approached Italy via the Mt. Cenis pass. Travelers conventionally stayed there for at least a couple of days, if not longer, to recover from the rigors of the journey and admire the view of the mountains which they had so recently traversed. As the \"bear-leader,\" [Joseph Spence](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4469){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1699-1768, years of travel 1731-3, and 1739-41), informed his mother: \"The view we have from the ramparts is the prettiest and the most extraordinary I ever saw in my life, for on one side you see the Alps, rugged and all covered with snow, and on the other the most beautiful hills sprinkled with little country seats, vineyards, fine clumps of wood, and the Po, running at the bottom of them.\"[^8] The presence of the court, reckoned by Spence \"one of the politest in Europe,\"[^9] was always an attraction, as were the royal art collections, the University and the formal symmetry, regularity and monumentality of the new town. The dramatic surge in visitors in the decade 1761-70 is therefore somewhat puzzling.\n\n[^8]: Slava Klima ed., *Joseph Spence: Letters from the Grand Tour* (Montreal and London: McGill University Press, 1975), p. 227, Spence to his mother, 7 Nov. 1739.\n\n[^9]: *Ibid*., p. 74, Spence to his mother, 27 Oct. 1731.\n\nThe spike in visitors might well reflect the vagaries of the evidence compiled for the *Dictionary* and the idiosyncrasies of principles for inclusion, but it could also be occasioned by shifts in Alpine travel, as discussed by [Midura in this volume](/gt-book/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival){:target=\"\\_blank\"}. One further reason for the attraction of Turin to British visitors is worth consideration: the Royal Academy (*Reale Accademia di Savoia*), reorganized by the King of Sardinia in 1729 for the education of the European elite and a key destination for many of the aristocratic youth, who stayed there for months at a time with their tutors. Young elite men attended the Accademia (and other similar academies throughout Europe) in order to perfect physical skills such as horsemanship, fencing, or dancing, and to be taught subjects such as fortifications and mathematics.[^10]\n\n[^10]: Paola Bianchi, \"In cerca del moderno. Studenti e viaggiatori inglesi a Torino nel Settecento,\" *Rivista storica Italiana*, 115:3 (2003), pp. 1021-51.\n\nYoung men and foreigners, advised [Thomas Martyn](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3215){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1735-1825, travel years 1779-1780, GTE 3215), could be trained there at moderate expense because the king defrayed part of the cost.[^11] The value for money emphasized by Martyn may not have been the deciding factor for aristocratic parents like the 10th Earl of Pembroke [Henry Herbert](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3799){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1734-1792, travel years 1753-1755, 1768-1769, 1784-1786, 1789, GTE 3799), who hoped rather that his \"tall, lank and bony\" offspring [George Augustus Herbert](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2363){:target=\"\\_blank\"}, 11th Earl of Pembroke (1759-1827, travel years 1779-1780, GTE 2363) would benefit from \"some attention to person, & Grace\" at the Accademia.[^12]\n\n[^11]: Thomas Martyn, *A Gentleman's Guide in his Tour through Italy, with a Correct Map and Directions for Travelling in that Country* (London, 1787), p. 29.\n\n[^12]: Lord Herbert ed., \\_Henry, Elizabeth and George (1734-1780): Letters and Diaries of Henry, 10\\_\\_th\\_ *Earl of Pembroke and his Circle* (London: Jonathan Cape, 1939), p. 184.\n\nAnalyzing visitor numbers by age indicates that, of the visitors that are known to have visited Turin, more youths were recorded here than in any other cities, such as Rome. Using their birth dates, I identified the number of travelers per decade who were between the ages of 15-25 at time of travel.[^13] This is an approximate exercise given that only around 41% of the entries have confirmed birth dates. However, it is likely that the majority of those whose birth dates are recorded would have been members of the aristocratic elite whose lives in general are so much better documented. The peaks in terms of the presence of travelers in Turin designated as \"youths\" based on this criteria can be related to those identified by Paola Bianchi in terms of attendance at the Accademia by British noblemen and their tutors.[^14] Bianchi's data shows that the Accademia was at its most popular amongst the British aristocratic elite during the period 1745-65, a pattern that calls for comparison with what the *Explorer* data shows.[^15]\n\n[^13]: At the time of writing, 2431 travelers have associated birth dates, out of the total 5972 in the *Explorer*.\n\n[^14]: Paola Bianchi, \"The British at the Turin Royal Academy: cosmopolitanism and religious pragmatism\", in Paola Bianchi and Karin Wolfe eds., *Turin and the British in the Age of the Grand Tour* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017), pp. 91-107, 399-410.\n\n[^15]: Paola Bianchi, 'In cerca del moderno', p. 1032\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\"></a>\n\n| Years   | Number of British |\n|:--------|------------------:|\n| 1733    |                 3 |\n| 1736-40 |                15 |\n| 1741-45 |                16 |\n| 1746-50 |                35 |\n| 1751-55 |                14 |\n| 1756-60 |                30 |\n| 1761-65 |                21 |\n| 1766-70 |                19 |\n| 1771-75 |                13 |\n| 1776-79 |                11 |\n| 1784-85 |                 3 |\n| 1786-90 |                 4 |\n\n<figure>\n\n<figcaption><b>Fig. 4:</b> Table indicating the number of recorded British travelers in Turin in residence at the Accademia.

Moreover, their presence in Turin was the more noticeable because as students of the Accademia they generally spent a period of months rather than days or weeks in the city, in contrast to the travelers who stayed only a couple of days before moving onwards.\n\nThe number of these \"classic\" Grand Tourists (meaning elite, young men) recorded in Turin can therefore be approached as reasonably accurate. Yet it should be noted that Bianchi's data, drawn from the records of attendees at the Accademia in the Treasury archives of Turin, includes 80 names of young men, their companions and their tutors, whose presence in Turin is not recorded in the *Dictionary*. In any case---and possibly also because of the different divisions of time in Bianchi (five year versus ten year intervals)---there is not an exact match in peak numbers between the *Explorer*'s data and that of Bianchi.[^16]\n\n[^16]: Bianchi, \"The British at the Turin Royal Academy,\" pp. 399-410. These figures should be treated with caution given that there is considerably uncertainty surrounding the identification of a number of the names due to vagaries of contemporary spelling and transliteration.\n\n<a name=\"figure-5a\"> </a>\n\n| Decade | Travelers to Italy (Known Birth Date) | Percentage of Whom Were Young Men | Travelers to Turin | Percentage of Whom Were Young Men | Travelers to Rome | Percentage of Whom Were Young Men |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1701-1710 | 170                                         | 60.59%         | 35                       | 40%            | 181                     | 32.04%         |\n| 1711-1720 | 194                                         | 45.36%         | 74                       | 29.73%         | 243                     | 23.87%         |\n| 1721-1730 | 223                                         | 43.5%          | 50                       | 24%            | 425                     | 18.82%         |\n| 1731-1740 | 280                                         | 48.57%         | 123                      | 40.65%         | 395                     | 22.28%         |\n| 1741-1750 | 215                                         | 42.79%         | 50                       | 36%            | 191                     | 27.75%         |\n| 1751-1760 | 278                                         | 46.4%          | 91                       | 45.05%         | 333                     | 28.53%         |\n| 1761-1770 | 382                                         | 46.86%         | 245                      | 27.35%         | 454                     | 25.33%         |\n| 1771-1780 | 401                                         | 35.41%         | 123                      | 20.33%         | 550                     | 18.18%         |\n| 1781-1790 | 353                                         | 31.44%         | 140                      | 18.57%         | 566                     | 13.25%         |\n| 1791-1800 | 284                                         | 30.28%         | 86                       | 17.44%         | 463                     | 14.04%         |\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5b\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sweet-figure-5b.svg\"  onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap5&apos;))\"/> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap5\">\n\n<b>Fig. 5:</b> Number of travelers aged 15-25 as percentage of traveler population with known birth dates by decade intervals.

Towner argued that the high point of the typical \"Grand Tour\" was in the mid-eighteenth century, and began to tail off thereafter as other types of traveler (Towner's \"middle classes\") increased in number.[^17] The detailed picture offered by the *Explorer* data is rather more interesting. The numbers---particularly in Rome and Naples, two of the most popular cities for which most information survives---continued to be higher than in the earlier part of the century. That said, as a proportion of the total number of travelers, the young men were becoming less significant. Meanwhile, a snapshot of those whom we know to have been \"middle aged\" (that is between forty and fifty) shows that their numbers per decade roughly doubled over the course of the century.\n\n[^17]: John Towner, \"The Grand Tour: a key phase in the history of tourism,\" *Annals of Tourism Research*, 12 (1986), pp. 297-333\n\n<a name=\"figure-6\"> </a>\n\n| Decade    | Total Number of Travelers (Known Birth Date) | Number of Middle-Aged Men | \\% Middle-Aged Men |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 1701-1710 | 170                                         | 15                        | 8.82%              |\n| 1711-1720 | 194                                         | 25                        | 12.89%             |\n| 1721-1730 | 223                                         | 28                        | 12.56%             |\n| 1731-1740 | 280                                         | 38                        | 13.57%             |\n| 1741-1750 | 215                                         | 25                        | 11.63%             |\n| 1751-1760 | 278                                         | 27                        | 9.71%              |\n| 1761-1770 | 382                                         | 53                        | 13.87%             |\n| 1771-1780 | 401                                         | 58                        | 14.46%             |\n| 1781-1790 | 353                                         | 61                        | 17.28%             |\n| 1791-1800 | 284                                         | 55                        | 19.37%             |\n\n<figure>\n\n<figcaption><b>Fig. 6:</b> Number of travelers aged 40-50 as count and as percentage of traveler population with known birth dates by decade intervals.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nOne of the great achievements of the *Explorer* is to have identified the many \"hidden\" women, buried in the *Dictionary*, for whom the compilers never thought to devote an entry in their own right. When mentioned, women were generally overshadowed by their male traveling companions: even [Harriet Carr](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/817){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1771-1848, travel years 1791-1794, GTE 817), the amateur artist and traveling companion of her brother, [John Carr](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/819){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1764-1817, travel years 1791-1794, GTE 819), upon whose journals most of the article on her brother's travels was based, only merited a minimal entry in the *Dictionary*, yet she now has an entry of her own in the *Explorer*.[^18] The numerous wives, sisters and daughters (often unnamed) who accompanied other travelers were even harder to detect---a similar problem hindered locating younger brothers and younger sons, servants and the many other unnamed fellow travelers. Many of these individuals have now been extracted from the records and given an entry in their own right in the *Explorer*. Yet the compilers of the *Dictionary* never set out comprehensively to record these \"lesser\" individuals, so despite the best efforts of those involved in the *Explorer* to overcome the aristocratic male bias, it is impossible to make visible those whose existence is not even mentioned in the *Dictionary*---a point taken up also by [Simon Macdonald in this volume](/gt-book/scholars-essays/macdonald-harlequin-horsemanship){:target=\"\\_blank\"}.\n\n[^18]: On the travels of the Carr siblings, see A.W. Purdue, \"John and Harriet Carr: a brother and sister from the north-east on the Grand Tour,\" *Northern History*, 30:1 (1994), pp. 122-38.\n\nAlthough the data will always remain frustratingly incomplete, the general trend illustrated in [Figure 7](#figure-7) shows a marked increase in female travelers during the last three decades of the eighteenth century. Taken with the increasing numbers of older male travelers, this data helps to provide firmer substance to the generalized assertions of an increasingly diverse traveling community by the last decades of the eighteenth century. The first woman to publish on travel to Italy was [Lady Anne Miller](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3324){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1741-1781, travel year 1770-1771, GTE 3324), whose *Letters from Italy* appeared, to a mixed reception from the public, in 1776.[^19] Notwithstanding some stinging criticism from [Horace Walpole](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4974){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1717-1797, travel years 1739-1741, GTE 4974) and others, Lady Miller's *Letters* enjoyed considerable popularity; subsequently other female travelers, such as [Hester Thrale Piozzi](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3880){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1741-1821, travel years 1784-1786, GTE 3880) and [Mariana Starke](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4512){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (c.1762-1839, travel years 1792-1798, GTE 4512), followed suit in publishing their own observations.[^20] The increasing numbers of female travelers and travel writers in the later eighteenth century---both domestically and in Europe and further afield---has rightly attracted recent scholarly attention.[^21] However, it is also important to acknowledge the presence of women *before* the 1770s, now revealed by the *Explorer*, and to be mindful that not all of them were the long-term resident wives of diplomats or merchants. These under-recorded women may not have engaged in the traditional pedagogic program of the Grand Tour or shared in all the cultural experiences that are traditionally held to have defined it, but they were in Italy, experiencing all the differences of cultural and social life that that implies, enduring the physical hardship and discomfort of foreign travel and contributing to and sharing in the experiences of their male companions.\n\n[^19]: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689-1762, travel years 1718, 1739-1741, 1746-1761, GTE 3395[LINK]) famously recorded her journeys, however they were only published later and seemingly against her will. Lady Anne Miller, *Letters from Italy, Describing the Manners, Customs, Antiquities, Paintings etc of that Country in the Years MDCCLXX and MDCCLXXI to a Friend Residing in France, by an English Woman,* 3 vols (London, 1776).\n\n[^20]: Hester Piozzi, *Observations and Reflections Made in the Course of a Journey Through France, Italy and Germany*, ed. Herbert Barrows (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1967); Marianna Starke, *Letters from Italy between the years 1792 and 1798*, 2 vols (London, 1800).\n\n[^21]: See for example, Emma Gleadhill, \"Improving upon birth, marriage and divorce: the cultural capital of three late eighteenth-century female Grand Tourists\", *Journal of Tourism Studies*, 10:1 (2018), pp. 21-36; Zoe Kinsley, *Women Writing the Home Tour* (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 2008); Jane Stabler, \"Taking liberties: the Italian picturesque in women's travel writing\", *European Romantic Review* 13:1 (2002), pp. 11-22; Katherine Turner, *British Travel Writers in Europe 1750-1850* (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2001); Kathryn Walchester, *Our Own Fair Italy.

[Figure 8](#figure-8) compares the number of female travelers against the number of male youth and men of middle age and unspecified age. The most striking point to emerge is that from the 1770s the numbers of women rivaled those of young men traveling in Italy. As already noted, the data, particularly with regard to ages, is incomplete, but it does demonstrate the degree to which patterns of travel had changed by the last two decades of the century. The Grand Tour was increasingly being undertaken by families and groups of mixed ages and genders, whose presence comes across clearly in the more qualitative evidence of journals and correspondence.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-8\" class=\"fig\"> <img src=\"sweet-figure-8.svg\"  onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap8&apos;))\"/> </a>\n\n<figcaption id=\"cap8\">\n\n<b>Fig. 8:</b> Bar graph charting the numbers of men, women, and subset of young men among travelers. By 1771-1780, the number of female travelers had outpaced the number of young men.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe changing social profile of travelers was also one of social background and class. This is harder to pursue through the *Explorer*, again due to the limited data for the non-aristocratic elite. The largest single \"Occupations & Posts Group\" category on the *Grand Tour Explorer* is that of statesman or politician (884 individuals) followed by the Army and Navy (291 individuals), confirming the image of the Grand Tour as the training ground of the future social, political and military elite. That said, the statesmen and politicians were precisely those people whose careers are easiest for historians to trace. Only 1,486 of the individuals in the *Dictionary* (just around a quarter of the total) were assigned explicit occupations and posts, leaving the majority without. The \"Employment and Identifier\" category offers another approach, but with its [own caveats](/gt-book/the-grand-tour-explorer/explanation){:target=\"\\_blank\"}.\n\nTwo natural subsets for considering the \"non-elite\" traveler might be the clergy and merchants, however they are each difficult to consider independently from other Grand Tourists for different reasons. Aristocratic young men were almost always accompanied by tutors who were very often members of the clergy, such as the [Reverend Joseph Spence](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4469){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1699-1768, travel years 1731-1733, 1739-1741, GTE 4469), whose comments on Turin from two separate tours that he made in the company of, respectively, the [Earl of Middlesex](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3305){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1711-1769, travel years 1731-1733, 1736-1738, GTE 3305) and the [Earl of Lincoln](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2956){:target=\"\\_blank\"} (1720-1794, travel years 1739-1741, GTE 2956), have already been quoted. Merchants are a reasonably numerous category to consider (157 individuals are identified as merchants) but the results of this exercise are skewed by the inclusion of long-term residents in the *Dictionary*, such as the merchants from the English factory at Livorno (Leghorn), who are discussed in this volume in the essays by [Reinert](/gt-book/scholars-essays/reinert-economic-grand-tour){:target=\"\\_blank\"} and [Macdonald](/gt-book/scholars-essays/macdonald-harlequin-horsemanship){:target=\"\\_blank\"}. A number of merchants from Britain did travel, sometimes using the occasion to visit foreign business partners as the opportunity to partake of the wider cultural experience offered by Italy, however merchants were much more likely to be semi-permanent residents of various Italian ports.[^22] Similarly, there was a preponderance of clergy in Rome, which reflects the centrality of Rome to the tour. But for the clergy more than for any other group, Rome would have been a particularly significant destination, given that most clergymen would have enjoyed a rigorously classical education and many had a professional interest in the history of the Christian church. While these groups often had professional ties to the Grand Tour, they complicate our idea of a \"traveler\" on tour.\n\n[^22]: See for example John Patteson and Robert Harvey who were both textile merchants from Norwich; although Patteson for some reason is not returned in a search for \"merchant\": D. Cubitt, A.L Mackley and R.G. Wilson eds., *The Great Tour of John Patteson, 1778-1779,* Norfolk Record Society, vol. lxvii (2003) and Norfolk Record Office MS 20677, Journal of Robert Harvey, 1773. The bookseller James Robson also combined business with pleasure, traveling to Italy to examine the Pinelli Library in Venice in 1787, combining that journey with the traditional itinerary of the Grand Tour (British Library Add MS 38837).\n\nIt is, in fact, relatively difficult to use the *Explorer* to investigate the social backgrounds of travelers from beyond the landed elite. This is due to the limitations of the information in the original *Dictionary*, the inconsistency with which it was recorded by the compilers (for whom documenting social change within the traveling community was not a primary concern) and the blurred lines within British society that separated members of the landed, professional and mercantile classes. Towner's assertion of higher levels of middle class participation is perhaps more emphatic than the data of the *Explorer* suggests; while there is an inherent aristocratic bias in the *Explorer*, Towner's methodology of analyzing published tours similarly has an inbuilt bias towards the middle classes who were far more likely than the aristocracy and landed elite to enter into print.[^23]\n\n[^23]: There were exceptions, of course: see for example *Letters from Italy in the Years 1754 and 1755 by the Late Right Honourable John, Earl of Corke and Orrery, Published from the Originals, with Explanatory Notes, by John Duncombe* (London, 1773); or Sir Richard Colt Hoare, *Hints to Travellers in Italy* (London, 1815). <!--stackedit_data:\n    eyJoaXN0b3J5IjpbNTI4Njc2NTU5LDU4OTk1NjE0OCwxNzk5NT\n    c5MzA1LDQ5NzgzNTk1MCwxNDk3NzUzNjEwLC04Mjk5MDY1Njgs\n    NTI4Njc2NTU5LDUyODY3NjU1OSwtNjI2MTM5Njg1LDEzNzk3MD\n    I0MTcsLTE0MTE5MTAsLTkwODc2OTI5OCw2NzA0Nzc3NTEsLTEz\n    NDE3MTI3MzEsLTU1NTgxODg0NSwtNjMwMDQxNzEzLDExOTYxOT\n    Y0MzFdfQ==\n    -->\n\nOne of the great pleasures of using the *Dictionary* is the wealth of extraordinarily diverse information that it records within the limits of multiple biographical entries, and which cumulatively constitute a uniquely detailed history of eighteenth-century travel. In its print version, it is unwieldy to use systematically (although a number of researchers claim to have read it cover to cover). The *Explorer*, however, makes this information fully discoverable for the first time: as this essay has attempted to show, evolving itineraries or the changing composition of the traveling community by age and gender can be delineated with a far greater degree of confidence than is possible simply through more qualitative analysis. The shortcomings of the data, however, discussed in the Introduction, must always render the conclusions provisional: as this essay has also shown, the questions that researchers may ask of the data were not necessarily those that the compilers had in mind when writing the entries and this has a bearing on the results that the *Explorer* generates. Nonetheless, the *Explorer* makes it possible to establish with far greater confidence who was traveling where and when, thereby providing the framework around which a much more nuanced history of the experience of travel in Italy may be written.\n\n<div class=\"dataButton\" onclick=\"window.open('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/120Bwnn16eUzjA7ivNstfvX7YzRN2LJBpUKRklhoMGfo/edit#gid=0','mywindow');\">Download and explore the data behind this essay</div>\n\n<h3>References</h3>\n\n<div class=\"overlay\" id=\"popup\" style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column; flex-wrap: wrap; background: #f7f6f3\">\n    <div id=\"imgs\" style=\"height:80%\">\n        <div class=\"overlay-close\">\n            <a><i class=\"material-icons\">close</i></a>\n        </div>\n        <img id=\"img\">\n        <img id=\"img2\">\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"capWrapper\" style=\"height:20%\">\n        <p id=\"cap\" style=\"float:left; max-width:80%; position:relative; left:120px; display:inline-block\"></p>\n        <div style=\"display:inline-block; float: right\">\n            <div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column; position:relative; right:100px; top:20px\">\n                <i class=\"material-icons link-cite\" aria-label=\"Cite this image\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">format_quote</i>\n                <i class=\"material-icons link-copy\" aria-label=\"Copy link to this image\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">link</i>\n                <i class=\"material-icons\" aria-label=\"Download\" data-balloon-pos=\"left\">arrow_downward</i>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n/*\n* Paired images should have the same height, the smaller of the two.\n*/\nfunction resize(obj, obj2, obj3){\n\n    if (!obj3) {\n        if (obj.height <= obj2.height) {\n            obj2.height = obj.height;\n        } else {\n            obj.height = obj2.height;\n        }\n    } else {\n        height = Math.min(obj.height, obj2.height, obj3.height);\n        obj.height, obj2.height, obj3.height = height;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction zoom(obj, obj2, caption) {\n    var popup = document.getElementById(\"popup\");\n    popup.style.maxHeight = \"90%\";\n    popup.style.height = \"90%\"\n    var image = document.getElementById(\"img\");\n    var image2 = document.getElementById(\"img2\");\n        \n    image.src = obj.src;\n    image.style.display = \"block\";\n    image.style.marginLeft = \"auto\";\n    image.style.marginRight = \"auto\";\n    image.style.left = \"0\";\n    image.style.right = \"0\";\n    image.style.width = \"100%\";\n    image.style.height = \"100%\";\n    image.style.objectFit = \"contain\";\n\n    image2.style.display = \"none\"; // hide in case Fig 1 or 2 were clicked\n    document.getElementById(\"capWrapper\").style.width = image.offsetWidth;\n\n    if (obj2 != undefined && obj2 != null) { // Figure 1 & 2 are paired\n        image.style.float = \"left\";\n        image.style.width = \"50%\";\n\n        image2.src = obj2.src;\n        \n        image2.style.display = \"block\";\n        image2.style.marginLeft = \"auto\";\n        image2.style.marginRight = \"auto\";\n        image2.style.left = \"0\";\n        image2.style.right = \"0\";\n        image2.style.float = \"left\";\n        image2.style.width = \"50%\";\n        image2.style.height = \"100%\";\n        image2.style.objectFit = \"contain\";\n\n        document.getElementById(\"capWrapper\").style.width = image.offsetWidth + image2.offsetWidth; \n    }\n    var cap = document.getElementById(\"cap\");\n    if (caption != undefined && caption != null) {\n        cap.innerHTML = caption.innerHTML;\n        cap.style.display = \"block\";\n        cap.style.marginTop = \"20px\";\n    } else {\n        cap.style.display = \"none\";\n    }\n    var overlays = document.getElementsByClassName(\"overlay\");\n      for (overlay of overlays) {\n        overlay.classList.remove(\"visible\");\n      }\n    popup.classList.add(\"visible\"); \n}    \n</script>"

It has long been known who is represented here: the jauntily leaning central figure is Charles Turner, the original owner of the painting, and on his left he is supported by Sir William Lowther. Seated to their left is Lord Bruce, and the figure standing in between is Thomas Steavens (who, as close examination reveals and sources confirm, was added expertly after the others were already painted). On the far left is Sir Thomas Kennedy, talking with the Irish peer of the group, James Caulfield, 1<sup>st</sup> Earl of Charlemont.[^1]\n\n[^1]: For the most detailed recent study of this painting that also supports these identifications, see Margery Morgan, “British Connoisseurs in Rome: Was it painted by Katherine Read?” *British Art Journal*, vol. 7, no. 1, Spring/Summer 2006, p. 40-44.\n\nAll these men were indeed in Rome on the Grand Tour in their early twenties, and all belonged to the group, led by Lord Charlemont, that sponsored the establishment in 1752 of an academy in Rome to support British artists—a short-lived institution credited as an inspiration for the Royal Academy, founded in London in 1768. Lord Charlemont can be considered the most prominent of the six: he stayed abroad, mostly in Rome, for almost nine years, serving as patron to numerous British and Italian artists, collecting profusely, and socializing with both travelers and Italian notables. He returned home and became a leading political figure of his day while commissioning and championing the construction of various classically inspired buildings that even today mark Ireland’s built environment. To various degrees, the other five also went on to occupy political positions, join societies, and collect and sponsor architecture inspired by their tours. \n\nApart from three minuscule local stock figures in the painting’s background, no others can be seen. Completely invisible are those who made these British Mi’Lords’ travels possible: tutors, servants, and staff, as well the many others with whom they interacted en route—Britons, but also Italians and other foreign travelers and residents. Women are nowhere to be found, although art historians have determined (after four mistaken attempts at attribution) that, ironically, the painting itself was the work of Katharine Read, one of the very few female artists who traveled and worked in Italy in the eighteenth century.[^2] Both Charlemont and Lord Bruce were also admirers of the musical accomplishments and regular visitors of another woman, the Irish traveler Miss Eugenia Peters. Charlemont, moreover, is attested as to having had, at one point during his time in Rome, four Italian servants, an Irish valet, plus two additional English employees. The other five men likewise met, socialized, and traveled with a wide range of people, many also from far less privileged social and economic backgrounds.\n\n[^2]: See Sama in this volume for how Read also operated in a distinct weave of women’s networks.\n\nMore glaring, but also to an extent more identifiable, are omissions today apparent in Johan Joseph Zoffany’s famous painting *The Tribuna of the Uffizi*, with its more crowded cast of mostly young touring British elites, likewise engaged in the conspicuous consumption of Italy’s classical past. Zoffany shows us a couple of tutors, artists, a diplomat, and a military officer, but again there are no women, no members of the lower classes, and no locals or Italians present, but for the director of the Uffizi himself, Pietro Bastianelli, holding the famous Venus by Titian for the visitors’ inspection. Thanks to Bastianelli’s administration, we have archival records for the Uffizi in these years showing that visitors skewed aristocratic and foreign, with the British in the majority. But these same records show that many foreigners’ visits were by women, that many toured with Italians as guides or companions, and that more artists yet came on their own to study and copy works in the collection. The scene would also have included Italians from Florence and other cities and states, and among the Florentines there would have been non-elites, who may have ranged from dancers to cooks, from fishmongers (“Baccani pesciaiolo”) to women upholsterers (“tappeziera”). The archival records contain specifics for only about half of the visitors, and we can imagine that those who have been recorded are generally the more socially distinguished, but servants’ journals also record their own visits.[^3]\n\n[^3]:See the extraordinary study of the Uffizi visitors’ records by Anna Floridia, *Forestieri in Galleria.

Two of the four traveling servants whose accounts Richrda Ansell has edited and studied mention visiting the Uffizi while in Flroence with their employers—see Richard Ansell, *Servants Abroad: Travel Journals by British Working People, 1765-1798*, forthcoming in 2024 in the British Academy’s Records of Social and Economic History Series, Oxford University Press. \n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-2\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-2.png\" id=\"fig2\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap2&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap2\">\n\nJOHAN JOSEPH ZOFFANY (FRANKFURT 1733-LONDON 1810) *The Tribuna of the Uffizi* 1772-77.\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nPaintings like Read’s and Zoffany’s represent typical portrayals of the Grand Tour, but *A World Made by Travel* aims to bring to life what lies beyond the canvas.

We learn also about them after their travels: two died shortly after their returns from Italy; of the other four, two are better known for their scholarly attainments, and both in time were elected to the Royal Society and the Society of Dilettanti, but all went into occupations of power and wealth. \n\nAt the same time, information about other travelers <ins>they associated</ins> with and the [other one hundred and twenty-one travelers](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/explore/%7B%22travelPlace%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Rome%22%7D%5D%7D,%22travelDate%22:%7B%22startYear%22:%221751%22,%22endYear%22:%221752%22%7D%7D) known to have been in Rome in 1751-1752, is now readily available, recreating an expanded social context. Those most immediately associated with the six travelers may themselves have been elite travelers, but both Italian and British artists were their most numerous points of connection, as figure 1.2 shows. Also in the mix were some diplomats, who remain important sources of information about the travelers who relied on them during their journeys. But the graph reveals connections to even wider networks, which begin to encompass women, as well as tutors and servants who were Italian, British and Irish.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-3\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-3.png\" id=\"fig3\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap3\">\n\nFig 1.2\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nReconstructing all the other interactions and relationships behind and beyond *British Gentlemen in Rome* brings us closer to the daily dynamics behind the making of modern culture, from Charlemont’s sponsorship of art and architecture to the dedication of his tutor (who was granted a life-long stipend after the tour), from the domestic labors of unnamed servants who made homes for the travelers in foreign places, to the women—including Read, Italian singers, and various intellectuals and socialites—with whom these and other travelers interacted.\n\nAll this emerges from the *Grand Tour Explorer*, a new research tool which is at the core of *A World Made for Travel*. The *Explorer*’s principal source is the *Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy, 1701–1800*, compiled by John Ingamells from the Brinsley Ford Archive and published in 1997. An archive of archives, so to speak, the *Dictionary* has a decades-long history of its own [LINK]. The *Explorer* recasts this unique prosopographical reference as a dynamic resource with search, browsing, visualization and other interactive features—including the ability to download information in any number of configurations—that allows researchers to study travelers’ lives and journeys anew. At the same time, it reveals a vast array of previously unknown or overlooked Grand Tour travelers, decentering the elite and well-known by bringing into the story hundreds of women, servants, workers and Italians not represented among the original *Dictionary*’s primary headings, even if they appear within its textual entries. Thus have the 4992 biographical entries compiled by the *Dictionary* increased, through the *Explorer*, to 6005.\n\n*A World Made by Travel* aims to share data with scholars and other users both at scale and in response to particular questions, synthesizing a reference work with original research in an interactive online format. Its distinctive contribution is to harness tools and practices emerging in the new field of digital history to transform and enrich our understanding of eighteenth-century, particularly British, travel to Italy—both its historical significance and its continuing influence. More broadly, the project is meant to showcase and make accessible to researchers, students and the general public the possibilities of digital history in a digital format, as demonstrated through data, maps, archival records, original research essays and other tools that raise new questions and forge new connections with unprecedented granularity. *A World Made by Travel* poses a set of evolving answers to the question of what it means to do historical research digitally, in particular with historical data concerning thousands of lives.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-4\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-4.png\" id=\"fig4\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap4\">\n\nFig 1.2\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<h1 align=\"center\">* * *</h1>\n\nThe Grand Tour at the heart of *A World Made by Travel* is that of British travelers journeying to Italy. As Britain’s global reach spread during the course of the eighteenth century, more and more Britons undertook this travel: exact numbers are hard to come by, as there is not a single archive for British travelers to the continent, but estimates put the number at more than ten thousand per year. [^4]\n\n[^4]:There is no one definitive source of data to calculate exact numbers of travelers, as recalled by John Towner who nevertheless worked hard to provide estimates. Towner, combining primary sources’ estimations with careful thinking through population numbers, and class and affordability dimensions, suggested that between ten and fifteen thousand British were abroad per year—but of course not all of them would venture as far as Italy; see Towner 1985: 300-310. \n\nThe eighteenth century has indeed been hailed as the golden age of the Grand Tour, but it is important to remember that continental travel for education, tourism, and art-collecting existed well before and after this period. The term Grand Tour itself was coined by Richard Lassels—a British tutor who visited Italy five distinct times with different charges—in 1670, in his immensely successful and long-lasting travel guide *The Voyage of Italy*, and British elites had traveled to Italy as tourists since the Renaissance. And the end of the century did not see the end of such travel. The age of revolutions and the Napoleonic wars certainly disrupted itineraries and practices of eighteenth-century continental travels. And these interruptions, alongside changes brought about by technology including, in time, the steamboat and then the train, deeply transformed travel to Italy. But they did not diminish it; if anything, journeys to Italy grew more frequent and numerous in the nineteenth century, and the transformation into mass tourism was a long and complex one. Nor was the Grand Tour limited geographically to Italy. Lassels himself recommended the tour of Italy as part of a longer itinerary, debating the merits of touring France or Germany and Holland on the way to or from Italy. There was of course no direct way to Italy (if not by sea), but it is also true that these other places were destinations in and of themselves, whether Italy was reached or not. Paris saw many more British visitors than Italy—for some mere money constraints limited their journey to France. And others also went beyond Italy, using Italy as a launching pad for destinations further beyond in the Mediterranean. Lastly, it was not just Britons travelling. Archives tells us as much: the Uffizi’s records. for example, show many French visitors, as well as other Europeans and few from other continents (extending from North America to North Africa) alongside the British.\n\nA fluid historical experience like the Grand Tour is hard to fit into strict geographical, chronological, or national boundaries. Goethe, a German, visited Italy in the late 1780s, but did not publish his most influential account—*Italienisch Reise*, among whose most vivid pages are those set in that British center of sociability and collecting that was Sir William Hamilton’s house in Naples—until 1816. The *Dictionary* itself, focused as it is on the British and Irish in Italy from 1701 to 1800, seeps beyond its own margins—something that the computational and data approach makes very clear, highlighting locations outside of Italy, dates before and after the eighteenth century, and many people beyond the British and Irish travelers of its title. \n\nWhile using “Grand Tour” in reference in particular to eigheteenth-century British travel to Italy and the sustained conversation that, in the eighteenth century and since, centered it, *A World Made by Travel* acknowledges this wider context. Indeed, there were, of course, nearly as many pathways to Italy, and as many reasons for traveling there, as there were travelers who undertook the journey. *A World Made of Travel* seeks to honor the variety of people who collectively constituted this distinctive world, while also keeping an eye on the essential, widely shared sense at the time that an Italian journey—particularly when imperial power was shifting from the South toward the North and the West—held the key to becoming a citizen of the world. \n\nFor cultural and social elites in the late eighteenth century, that phrase—“a citizen of the world”—succinctly captured the allure of Italy; as the English critic Samuel Johnson remarked, “a man who has not been in Italy, is always conscious of an inferiority, from his not having seen what it is expected a man should see.” Dotted with the monuments that elites knew from their reading of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and populated by influential contemporaries who might be encountered in the flesh, the Italian peninsula promised an educational rite of passage rooted in humanist ideals of classical origins. Every journey, however, involved many other people, including (despite Johnson’s masculine language) women—a fact that highlights important questions about who gets remembered and how their journeys are interpreted.\n\nThe story of the Grand Tour of Italy is a story of nations as well as of individuals, and as such it holds enormous cultural and historiographical significance today. To study this transformative historical phenomenon, to think about its participants and to re-create their paths, is to encounter an increasingly diffuse learned community whose travels helped shape the modern world as we know it. This was a community of travelers consisting of reluctant youths and intrepid women, of scientists and artists, of the Enlightenment’s most sensitive minds and influential writers and of many other, mostly unnamed figures, among them diplomats, merchants, sea captains, doctors, governesses, and servants, who made these travels possible and who may not have been seeking an educational rite of passage at all—who instead sought professional advancement, or a way to make a living, or who did not even travel by choice. The countless crossed paths that constituted this world of travel, its multifarious exchanges of material objects as well as ideas, and interactions, many planned but as many unexpected, contributed to a massive reimagining of politics and the arts, of the market for culture, of ideas about leisure, and of professional practices such as archaeology, the teaching and collecting of art, but also diplomacy and politics.\n\nAnd yet the Grand Tour, despite being a fundamental engine of modern life, has long posed a considerable historiographical challenge. Our grasp on this phenomenon today is constrained by the widely dispersed documents through which we can study and come to know it. Not that there is a shortage of existing texts: many travelers kept journals and wrote letters, a number of which were published at the time, and those published “travels” were themselves shaped not just by ancient texts but also by previous travelers’ accounts. Even these texts, however, account for the travels of only a fraction of those who voyaged to the Italian peninsula in these years. So while the enormous scale of the Grand Tour, with numerous individuals traveling across a vast geography, is well understood today—indeed this is seen as a crucial feature of its influence—the fact remains that when we define and understand it through the writings of only a small selection of travelers, we barely glimpse its scope.\n\nWritten accounts, published or in manuscript, of course, are merely a trace of the record left behind by Grand Tour travel. Archival records are widely dispersed throughout Italy and Britain and an extraordinary amount of visual evidence remains, even down to the painted depiction of individual travelers (after all, having one’s portrait painted in Italy, whether at full-length or in miniature, was a sought-after prize). Such records, though, can suppress as much as they reveal. Because the Italian Grand Tour, a formative institution of modernity, was constituted by the movement of *people*, relying on the most well-known accounts and depictions risks ignoring much of its actual life and enormous subsequent impact.\n\nMore stories expand the scope of our knowledge, but counting is always tied to intersecting categories, thanks to the richly documented and multidimensional character of our data. Thus the lives and journeys of travelers otherwise hard to ascertain or bring together for counting can be brought to bear in the same picture and narrative. Data visualization and data analysis allow us to see many more people than before in this approach committed to the interplay between the qualitative and the quantitative, and sensitive to the unknown in the historical past. When historians began dreaming, with the advent of the personal computer in the early 1990s, of the new possibilities of processing large amounts of data quickly and easily and of exchanging datasets and information via machines, they could scarcely imagine the ease of today’s file transfers or the dynamic web applications that allow us to zoom in and out from individuals to group, draw networks and connections, and manipulate categories in our explorations. Yet this exponential computational growth and the advent of artificial intelligence have revealed all the more the importance of careful source and data criticism. To quote Mateusz Fafinski, “historical data is not a kitten, it’s a saber-toothed tiger” that will undermine any work not attending to its complex uncertainties and missing records.[^5] A dynamic digital tool like the *Grand Tour Explorer* opens exciting new vistas and approaches to eighteenth-century British travel to Italy, but doing research with historical data requires as much scholarly attention and care as traditional historical research.\n\n[^5]:Fafinski, Mateusz \"Historical data. A portrait.\" *History in Translation* (blog), 29 Sep 2020, [https://mfafinski.github.io/Historical_data/](https://mfafinski.github.io/Historical_data/).\n\n**1.2 <ins>THE NEW WORLD OF GRAND TOUR STUDIES</ins>**\n\n*A World Made by Travel*’s distinctive contribution is to harness tools and practices emerging in the new field of digital history to transform and enrich our understanding of eighteenth-century, particularly British, travel to Italy—both its historical significance and its continuing influence. But it also builds on a tremendous groundswell of exciting scholarly work undertaken in recent decades on the nature and meaning of the multifaceted world of travel to Italy. \n\nFor a long time, research on travel was difficult to fit into academic institutions, and it is perhaps partly for this reason that crossover work of interest to a wider public and done by independent scholars has filled the gap.[^6] The elaborately researched surveys by Christopher Hibbert and Jeremy Black, successful as they were in the trade press, also heralded a new academic turn.[^7] In the 1990s, as interdisciplinarity flourished, Grand Tour Studies re-emerged and attracted cultural historians seeking to forge connections among intellectual, political, and art history and bringing sophisticated literary analysis to bear on seemingly mundane travel writings. Exhibitions in London, Rome, and Philadelphia put on literal display the Grand Tour’s potential as a subject of interdisciplinary scholarship, telling its story through paintings, ancient and modern sculpture, and touristic artifacts ranging from prints to painted fans. The lavishly produced and illustrated catalogues of these exhibitions, as well as the edited volumes based on related conferences, brought together scholars from disparate disciplines to provide context and analysis.[^8] This moment also originated a new, rich season of research, as scholars such as Philip Ayres, Jonathan Scott, Viccy Coltman, Ruth Guilding and Joan Coutu investigated a broad cultural dialogue about republican *virtù* and neoclassical taste, studying the complex and richly cultivated ideals embodied in the artifacts collected by Grand Tourists: from marble busts of themselves, commissioned in Rome and made to resemble ancient Roman statues, to Greek painted vases used to decorate their sitting rooms, often atop mantelpieces of neoclassical design.[^9]  \n\n[^6]: For a review of Grand Tour studies starting in 1900, see Edward Chaney, “Bibliography: A Century of British and American Books on the Evolution of the Grand Tour, 1900–2000,” in Chaney, *The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance*, 2nd ed.

Edward Chaney, ed., *The Evolution of English Collecting: The Reception of Italian Art in the Tudor and Stuart Periods* (New Haven, Conn., 2004), shows Italy’s crucial role in the earlier origins of English collecting.\n\nAs an institution, the Grand Tour was established on the original humanist belief that classical education forged modern men. Not all Grand Tourists were seen as manifesting the ideal: Lady Montagu, for instance, lamented the vulgarity of the English youth she encountered, and tutors frequently complained about their unruly charges.[^10] Other instances of disappointment offer further proof of the paradox, as described in essential works by Chloe Chard and Bruce Redford, respectively exploring foreign modes of experiencing travel in Italy in general and Venice in particular.[^11] Melissa Calaresu and Nelson Moe have analyzed foreign representations of Italian decline that situate Italy on the margins of modernity, though they do so in order to interrogate the limits of Enlightenment ideals of cosmopolitanism.[^12] Others, including Paula Findlen, have unmasked this mediated, imaginary Italy in a way that allows for a clearer view of the vibrant modernity of eighteenth-century Italian culture.[^13] These penetrating investigations of the Grand Tour’s ideals and cultural dynamics have recently led to a sustained look at the lived reality of the Grand Tour. \n\n[^10]: Mary Wortley Montagu, *The Complete Letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu*, ed.

Questions such as these animate Rosemary Sweet’s recent work.[^15] A 2012 exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford of items from the cargo of the British merchant ship *Westmorland*, which it was possible to reconstruct as an ensemble thanks to painstaking work on the archival records of its 1778 capture during the Anglo-French wars, put on display a vivid cross-section of the Grand Tour in keeping with this recent scholarly turn. The ship’s contents, including works of art acquired by Grand Tourists, notebooks and personal possessions, and luxury market goods such as silk, olives, and thirty-two wheels of Parmesan cheese, offer detailed insight into the tastes and interests not just of Grand Tourists in general, but also of specific travelers. The fascination with such particulars connects some of the most recent work to that of one of the very first scholars to cultivate the Grand Tour in academia, Edward Chaney, whose collected essays painstakingly examined, case study by case study, its various contexts.[^16]\n\n[^14]: John Brewer, “Whose Grand Tour?,” in María Dolores Sánchez-Jáuregui and Scott Wilcox, eds., *The English Prize: The Capture of the Westmorland, an Episode of the Grand Tour* (New Haven, Conn., 2012).\n[^15]: Rosemary Sweet, *Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c.1690–1820* (Cambridge, 2012); Sweet, “Why Is the Grand Tour Always about Men?,” paper delivered at the Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies Day Conference “Rethinking the Grand Tour: Questioning Cultures of Eighteenth-Century Travel,” University of York, March 8, 2014—see [http://www.york.ac.uk/eighteenth-century-studies/events/re-thinkingthegrandtourconference/]([http://www.york.ac.uk/eighteenth-century-studies/events/re-thinkingthegrandtourconference/).\n[^16]: Chaney, *The Evolution of the Grand Tour*.\n\nMore recent work zeroes in further on lived experiences and unexplored or unquestioned facets of the Grand Tour world. Scholars have focused on the places visited before and after Italy, readdressing the significance of travel in countries north of the Alps, given that many who left England did not make it all the way, that those who reached Italy by land spent much of their time in other locations en route, and that Italians themselves sometimes traveled North.[^17] Other scholars have plumbed archives old and new with great creativity to throw new light also on what preceded and followed travel in the lives of travelers. Richard Ansell has carefully explored how families strategized about their offspring’s travel and what the educational, social and financial outcomes of that travel were through subsequent generations, while Sarah Goldsmith’s research on how masculinity was constructed through traveling posits anew the role of the Grand Tour in shaping the British elites. Recent work on country houses and libraries, investigating the integration of imported objects, habits, and books in British genteel living, also extends our understanding of the afterlives of travel beyond art collecting.[^18]\n\n[^17]: See essays in Rosemary Sweet, Gerrit Verhoeven, and Sarah Goldsmith, *Beyond the Grand Tour: Northern Metropolises and Early Modern Travel Behaviour*, Routledge 2017.\n[^18]: Ansell, Richard, *Complete Gentlemen: Educational Travel and Family Strategy, 1650-1750*, Oxford University Press, 2022; Goldsmith, Sarah. *Masculinity and Danger on the Eighteenth-Century Grand Tour*.

(2017) *Travel and the British country house: Cultures, critiques and consumption in the long eighteenth century*, Manchester University Press, and Mark Purcell, *The Country House Library*, Yale UP.\n\nIlaria Bignamini already posed the crucial question of the role of Italians and of Italian culture in the Grand Tour in 1996.[^19] Careful new readings of sources have brought new light on the Tour’s Italian contexts and on practices of acculturation, from Arturo Tosi’s study of language acquisition to Calaresu’s research on cooking habits.[^20] Collaboration with Italian scholars has proved illuminating in this respect, from the already mentioned work by Findlen to the joint study by Paola Bianchi and Karen Wolfe of Turin’s academy. The Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerche sul Viaggio in Italia has done remarkable work in the field and Cesare De Seta’s thesis about the influence of the Italy envisioned by travelers on Italians’ self-image is at the core of the most recent and most expansive art exhibition on the Grand Tour, ‘Grand Tour. Sogno D’Italia da Venezia a Pompei,’ on display in Milan in 2021-2022.[^21] Deep dives into Italian archival sources, along with new analysis of well-known travelers’ account, have also added original texture and facilitated new disciplinary connections such as Brewer’s recent masterful article on the making of scientific knowledge through a study of the local guides taking visitors up Vesuvius.[^22] The image of the Grand Tour has indeed far expanded in scope from the original focus on travel by wealthy young man and on art collecting, as more participants come into view. While Brian Dolan’s work focused on the “ladies’s” Grand Tour, more recent scholarship is foregrounding the great variety of possible women’s travel experience. Explorations of non-elite travelers’ and servants’ experiences are also starting to be explored, both by reading anew well-known travel accounts, as in the work of Katherine Welchester, and also by the rare recovery of servants’ travel accounts from the archive, thanks to the research of George Boulokus and Richard Ansell.[^23]\n\n[^19]: Ilaria Bignamini, “Grand Tour: Open issues,” in Wilton, Andrew and Bignamini, Ilaria eds, *Grand Tour: the lure of Italy in the eighteenth century*, 1996.\n[^20]: Arturo Tosi, *Language and the Grand Tour.

In the same volume in which Brewer’s essay appeared, moreover, María Dolores Sánchez-Jáuregui wrote on the neglected figures of governors or “bear-leaders”—travel companions to younger, wealthy elite men, who directed their studies, managed the logistics and finances of their travels, and often influenced their collecting choices. Sánchez-Jáuregui was inspired by her research on the *Westmoreland*, the so-called “English Prize,” whose cargo contained evidence of bear-leaders’ activities. But it was the *Dictionary* that confirmed for her the value and possibilities of the subject, and which provided her a major source of information about 174 tutors.\n\n*A World Made of Travel* pushes even further in this direction of expansion. Although its starting point is the abundance of detail in the *Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy*, the *Grand Tour Explorer* makes it possible to foreground all travelers, despite scarce or uncertain information, including those effectively hidden until now. The *Dictionary* is indeed animated by an unusually wide cast of characters, which in part is a testament to the eclectic collecting and research interests of Ford as well as the many who worked with him to build his archive of travelers, but the *Explorer* increases this cast by over a thousand, of which more than half are women. \n\nBeyond the many stereotypically wealthy Grand Tourists, there are entries for students of the arts and resident artists, humanists (whether scholars of manuscripts or antiquities), merchants, military men, diplomats, and Jacobite exiles. The variable length of the entries reflects variation in what is known about individual travelers, both during and beyond their travels. Many of the longest entries belong to familiar figures whose tours are substantively documented--such as [Lady Montagu](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3395)(1689-1762, travel years 1718, 1739-41, 1746-61) and [Sir William Hamilton](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2219) (1730-1803, travel years 1764-1800). Less famous figures who nonetheless left behind precise documentation of their travels--such as [Lord Charlemont](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/897) (1728-99, travel years 1747-54) and the artist [Richard Dalton](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1276) (1713?-1791, travel years 1739-43, 1747-50, 1758-59, 1762-63, 1768-69, 1774-75)-- also have lengthy entries, as do people who stayed long in Italy. Well-known figures whose tours were neither extensive nor thoroughly documented, however, such as the philosopher [David Hume](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2575) (1711-76, travel year 1748), whose journey ended at Turin, warrant briefer entries. \n\nFinally, there are those travelers about whom almost nothing is known; at times only their names survive, and even those might be uncertain but are still included. This is the case, for example, for a few of the artists mentioned in the crucial and mysterious document known as “Hayward’s List,” which consists of “a gathering of ten octavo-sized pages stitched together” that records in neat handwriting the names and the arrivals of British artists in Rome from 1753 to 1775.[^24] Taken together, the *Grand Tour Explorer*’s entries allow *A World Made of Travel* to present a newly expansive sense of the Grand Tour’s diversity. This was a world much more densely populated than the one we see in the individual journals of Grand Tourists or much of the scholarship based on them, but fully consonant with the new findings of recent Grand Tour studies.\n\n[^24]: Lindsay Stainton, ‘Hayward’s List: British Visitors to Rome 1753-1775,’ The Volume of the Walpole Society, Vol 49 (1983), pp.3-36, which also tells the story of the reemergence of this eighteenth-century unique source starting with a 1928 letter to *The Times Literary Supplement* is recounted. \n\n**1.3 THE *EXPLORER***\n\nCreating the *Grand Tour Explorer* was a multi-year, multi-step, iterative and collaborative process. Not only the tool but the process itself grew in scale and complexity alongside contemporary technological developments—a story recounted in detail in “<ins>From Archive to Explorer</ins>.” Offered here is an explanation of the nature of the *Explorer* and the stakes of the transformation it represents from print source to digital data, to an online and interactive research resource, and an introduction to the new approach that it enables for the study of eighteenth-century travel to Italy.\n\nAt the core of the *Explorer*, as of the *Dictionary*, is the individual entry. Atomized content organized around the lives of individuals has long been the foundation of prosopographies. The *Grand Tour Explorer* pushes this principle even further than its print source. Where some entries in the *Dictionary* might have had headings representing two or more people—for example, husbands and wives or other groupings—these have been broken down in the *Explorer* into individual entries, with one for each traveler. (There are some exceptions, where a lack of information made it impossible to identify individual travelers.) Cutting against the principle of individuation in the *Explorer*, however, is a thoroughgoing practice of interconnection, by virtue of various links that encourage movement from one entry to another, in digital fashion. At every stage the transformation of the (print) *Dictionary* into the (online, digital) *Grand Tour Explorer* has required thinking through and deciding what can be lost as well as gained by moving a prosopography from page to screen—thus, this is also a story about biographical dictionaries in the digital era.\n\nBiographical dictionaries are not meant to be read from start to finish. In libraries they have traditionally sat among other dictionaries and encyclopedias in reference rooms, where information is organized and stored for easy consultation. Their structure is governed by the fact of their atomized content and arranged under headings, typically ordered alphabetically. In print, these dictionaries also lend themselves to cross-referencing. For example, some reference works put terms in bold to indicate a separate but related entry; in the case of the *Dictionary*, references to other entries are made by directing the reader to “see [*x*].”\n\nIn recent years, cross-referencing in online biographical dictionaries has gone well beyond the possibilities afforded by specific hypertext links which was the initial added feature when first text moved online. For instance, born-digital Wikipedia has grown into the largest-ever encyclopedia in only twenty years, particularly on account of how it facilitates searching and sorting, allows and encourages reading as consultation, and enables the reader to move across diverse kinds of content. Some have questioned whether it will even be possible for traditional reference works (such as a national biographical dictionary) to survive in this new context and have wondered what changes could help them to adapt to the online environment.[^25] The *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography* has been at the forefront of this conversation since its appearance online in 2004. It has survived in part through annual updates adding new lives. And the marvel of its searching capabilities, which awed reviewers upon its very first appearance—“it is hard to think of any subject not illuminated by running word search through this colossal database,” wrote Keith Thomas at the time[^26]—has only improved. Such are the wonders of metadata that readers now can search the ODNB’s lives by twenty different occupations, eight religious affiliations, and many of the locations and dates that appear within the biographies. Using a sidebar on the left, one can reach a desired entry, and within each entry the names of people in blue represent hyperlinks to other entries. This ongoing discussion around and experimentation with online biographical dictionaries is the context within which we have transformed the print *Dictionary* into the digital *Grand Tour Explorer*. \n\n[^25]: For a good overview see CARTER, PHILIP. “WHAT IS NATIONAL BIOGRAPHY FOR?: DICTIONARIES AND DIGITAL HISTORY.”*True Biographies of Nations?’: The Cultural Journeys of Dictionaries of National Biography*, edited by KAREN FOX, ANU Press, 2019, pp. 57–78. *JSTOR*, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvh4zjhx.7. Accessed 22 June 2023.](http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvh4zjhx.7) and also other essays in this collection.\n[^26]: Keith Thomas, *Changing Conceptions of National Biography: The Oxford DNB in Historical Perspective*, The Leslie Stephen Lecture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005) 35.\n\nSo what do the *Explorer*’s entries look like? Figure x shows a screenshot of an individual entry—in this case, that of [Charles Abbot](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/0) (1757-1829, travel year 1788), the alphabetized print *Dictionary*’s very first entry.   \n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-5\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-5.png\" id=\"fig5\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap5\">\n\nFig 5. Figure x shows an entry in *the Grand Tour Explorer* [give link also].\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nIn the center is the text of the entry as it appears in the print version, preserving it even down to the typography. This text, however, is flanked on either side by information derived from the print entry itself and formalized as data. The right-hand sidebar contains data about the travels (the sequence of recorded dates and places visited) as well as an animated map that visualizes this data, while the left-hand sidebar contains the traveler’s biographical details, the names of other travelers mentioned in the entry, and the entry’s sources—all sorted and grouped under the relevant category of data. Readers can scroll through all the entries in alphabetical order by moving with the arrow in the above banner right or left, similar to flipping through pages of the print *Dictionary*. They can also navigate from one entry to another, and they can explore several different entries by clicking on the links contained in the two flanking columns. Any name in hyperlinked font—of a spouse, a parent, or any other associated traveler—is clickable, and will bring the reader to that traveler’s entry. Any of the other data points that appear clickable—for example, an occupation, a biographical date, or a source on the left-hand side, or a place and time of travel on the right-hand side—will open up a list of all other entries that share that specific data point, such that a reader can easily navigate to (for example) a shared occupation (e.g. painter, member of parliament), or to all other travelers born in a specific year, or in a specific place at a specific time. On the Explore page, where all the categories of data appear as search fields, one can filter and browse in order to access all the corresponding entries. One can also explore multiple categories at once—for example, for travelers known to have traveled to Pisa and Rome between 1772 to 1775 who also happened to be members of the Royal Society.  \n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-6\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-6.png\" id=\"fig6\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap6\">\n\nFig 6\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nGiven the significance of space to travel, the print *Dictionary* includes two maps to orient the readers: an historical one from 1799 that shows roads and states at the time, and a modern one that includes more locations, but still falls short of including every place mentioned in the text, or all the boundaries of the eighteenth-century states into which Italy was divided at the time. This is a difficulty shared by all works trying to convey the complexity of political structure of eighteenth-century Italy, divided as it was into various states whose boundaries fluctuated. The *Explorer* Map view digitally resolves, in part, some of these issues. All of the locations within it are present, but become visible only when zooming in to avoid crowding and overlapping of labels. Rather than drawn boundaries on the map, the political entities are presented via different colors for locations, according to the states to which they belonged (seen in figure *y*). The map serves as a reference for readers: by typing in the search box any place mentioned in the *Explorer*, its location is shown. It also operates as an additional layer in in the reading of this digital transformation of the print *Dictionary*: to click on any of the locations displayed among the database’s places of travel on the map is to be taken to a list of entries of the travelers who are recorded as having visited that location.\n\nThe list of entries pervades the reader’s experience of the *Grand Tour Explorer*. Whether appearing as a vertical list showing the heading and first line of each entry, which readers can scroll as if they were reading an index, or as a horizontal scroll connecting one entry to the next, which readers can move along as if they were flipping the pages of a book, the list of entries is an essential touchstone. There is great power in this ability to explore and browse by multiple dimensions. One downside to this digital transformation, however, is the loss of an immediate, physical sense of the whole print *Dictionary*. Readers know from experience what it means to hold a thick, weighty volume in one’s hands and to flip through its pages; they get a tangible sense of the abundant information and (in the case of a biographical dictionary) numerous lives that it contains. The physical experience of a book can also reveal, at a glance, the disparities in the information available for different individuals. One might notice that a certain individual’s entry is spread across several pages, while another’s is compactly contained in a single paragraph. This can even make certain imbalances, such as those of gender representation, immediately apparent: in a printed biographical dictionary, one might flip through pages and pages without encountering a single woman’s name among the entries.  \n\nThe dot visualization in the *Grand Tour Explorer*, shown in figures *z* and *a*, aims to convey a similar, if necessarily imperfect, sense of the database as a whole. It shows all the travelers’ entries simultaneously and allows for sizing, sorting and coloring to represent the variation in entry lengths which is more immediately apparent in print, as well as the gender imbalance that one might grasp by flipping through the *Dictionary*.  \n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-7\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-7.png\" id=\"fig7\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap7\">\n\nFig 7\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-8\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-8.png\" id=\"fig8\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap8\">\n\nFig 8\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nHovering over an individual dot, readers can see the name of the corresponding traveler and visit the relevant entry with a click. Readers thus re-enter the entries and can once again thread their way through various travelers’ stories, sorting and browsing in the distinctive manner that makes the *Explorer* a dynamic version of the print *Dictionary*: its original texts are reproduced alongside data retrieved from them. This creates a multi-dimensional reading experience in a more layered structure than, for example, in the online *ODBN*, with a functionality that extends well beyond basic search. The *Explorer* thus adds to the *Dictionary* not just by the inclusion of hundreds of additional travelers, but also by ensuring that the travelers are perceived relationally *and* in aggregate. The individual travelers can easily be placed in evolving sets of wider horizons, by sorting and browsing various categories, which provices an expansive view of the world of the eighteenth-century travel to Italy. \n\n**1.4. A COMPLEX WORLD OF DATA**\n\nThe *Explorer*’s data, which any reader can easily download for their own analytical purposes, allows readers to explore central questions about scale and representation in eighteenth-century travel to Italy and to investigate anew various facets of this world. The full downloaded *Explorer* data consists of a staggering and complex number of data points about the journeys and the lives of the travelers in the database. There are close to half a million, for example, relating to the travels alone, a mix of string, Boolean and numeric data formalized to represent all the information about travelers’ journeys from the *Dictionary*. This amount is larger than any other open access data set available about eighteenth-century travel. Yet we know it falls short of what might have been: Towner estimates that tens of thousands traveled, which casts the 6,005 here in a different, more limited light.[^27] \n\n[^27]: Towner 1985.\n\nDespite the massive quantity of information contained in the *Explorer*, readers who download it should be aware that the data is shot through with absences and uncertainties. What the *Grand Tour Explorer* presents is the *Dictionar*y with all the richness *and* the limits of the information it assembled from multiple archives and sources. Many layers are represented in the data, each with its own version of missing information. There are the silences of the original archives—even the records in the ‘Note dei Forestieri’ from the Venice state archives, supposedly recording all coming and goings from the Venetian republic have their blind spots—let alone the biases from other sources (letters and journals, for example) which reflect what individual travelers chose to record or simply leave out. The *Dictionary* does the astounding work of stitching together information from disparate archives to reconstruct these eighteenth-century travels, filling many gaps but also connecting overlapping uncertainties. Within it one encounters unresolvable conflicts of evidence. For example, it places the future Cambridge professor of modern history John Symonds (1730-1807, travel years 1765-1771) in Rome in March 1766 “about to return through Paris to London”, because this is what is stated by Lawrence Sterne in a letter from Rome dated March 30, 1766.[^28] The next recorded location for Symonds in the *Dictionary* is May 1767, when he is said to be arriving in Florence from Bologna. But Symonds’ recently discovered manuscript journals show him in June 1766 touring Sicily together with the Neapolitan doctor and botany professor Domenico Cirillo, after arriving by land through the South of Italy. And in a letter to Linnaeus dated March 1^st^ 1766, Cirillo announced his imminent departure for a trip to Apulia and then Calabria and Sicily “with a friend.”[^29] Might Symonds have fit in a quick trip to Paris and London in April 1766 before making his way south with Cirillo? We simply do not know.\n\n[^28]: See letter in Electronic Enlightenment edition at [https://www.e-enlightenment.com/item/sterlaOU0010275a1c/](https://www.e-enlightenment.com/item/sterlaOU0010275a1c/)\n[^29]: Domenico Maria Leone Cirillo to Carl Linnaeus, L3737, April 1 1766: [https://linnean-online.org/77777654/#?s=0&cv=0](https://linnean-online.org/77777654/#?s=0&cv=0)\n\nIn addition to the irremediable gaps and inconsistencies the *Dictionary* (and subsequently the *Explorer*) inherited from its original sources, more were introduced through the selection process involved in assembling the *Dictionary*, and more complexity still was inserted by the various choices in transforming these printed records into *Explorer* data. The data itself, however, throws some of these patterns of presence and absence in the recording of historical experiences into sharp relief. This in turn helps readers grasp how the *Dictionary* itself represents information about eighteenth-century travel. And thoughtfully interrogating this rich set of travel and biographical data gives rise to new understandings of patterns in the past itself. \n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-9\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-9.png\" id=\"fig9\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap9\">\n\nFig 9\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nAny such engagement with the data requires an understanding of its shape and meaning. The visualization in fig x enables consideration of all the travel data at once and represents all locations and years of travel recorded in the database for the *Explorer*’s 6,005 travelers. The spatial data is mapped geographically in the upper band, where every dot represents a location, while the temporal data is shown as a timeline in the lower banner, in which each bar consists of all trips recorded for a given year. In the map view, the dots vary in size to indicate the number of visits to the various locations. The largest dots mark the cities of Rome, Venice, Naples, and Florence, which is not surprising: the first three were the largest cities in Italy at the time, and all four were and are well-known tourist travel destinations. More unexpected are the places that appear as the next most visited: Padua and Leghorn. Padua was an important location, sitting along the way to Venice by land and housing (then as now) both famous art and one of the most ancient and prestigious universities on the European continent. Since the Middle Ages, the university was a destination itself. Yet the relative dominance of Padua, overshadowing larger and politically and culturally important cities such as Genoa, Turin, or Milan, owes as much to the nature of the source of the data. An archival Visitor’s Book from the University in Padua, in which travelers were eager to sign their names, and which— printed in 1921—constitutes the second most quoted source in the *Dictionary* and therefore in the *Explorer*; [641 records](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/explore/%7B%22sources%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Brown%201921%22%7D%5D%7D%7D) are drawn from it. It is also true that the Visitors’ Book was well maintained only until 1730 and its use had petered out completely by 1765. Correspondingly, when one considers the presence of Padua in the travel data over time, this city drops significantly among visited places listed in the *Explorer* after 1730 [direct readers to Sweet but also video in *Explorer*?].\n\nConversely, there are places on the map that must have received many travelers but have been proportionally undercounted. Readers should be aware of the *flight map effect* of spatial data visualizations that can distort perceptions of historical data. In the eighteenth century, travelers could not just skip over a place, nor could they necessarily speed through one. Out of the 3,380 travelers recorded in Rome, 697 appear to have *only* been there, but these travelers must have stopped and visited other places on their way to Rome. We can well imagine that places such as Bologna—on one of the main throughways from North to South, and a destination in itself—must have had visits from more than the [671 travelers recorded](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/explore/%7B%22travelPlace%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Bologna%22%7D%5D%7D%7D) in the database as having spent time there. Yet this information was neither recorded in the sources consulted (or did not reach the *Dictionary*), nor was it subsequently added to the *Explorer* database.\n\nFor many of the travelers, the entries gather precious information from disparate sources—ranging from official archives to travelers’ journals or letters, or contemporary newsletters—and the result is a fragmentary travel record. For those traveling between Rome and Naples, for example, the passport check was at Capua; an official document records with precision down to the day, month, and year (with some uncertainty in the spelling of names) when travelers stopped at this checkpoint, a document that was mined extensively to compile the *Dictionary*’s entries. For fifty-nine travelers in the database this is all we have of their Italian journeys in their *Dictionary*’s entries and, therefore, the *Explorer*, but of course their tours were more extensive than just Capua.[^30] Even for better known travelers with well-documented journeys, the travel data remains at times fragmentary. [Anne Miller](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3324) (1741-81, travel years 1770-1) richly documented her 1770-1771 tour in regular correspondence that she published in 1776 as *Letters from Italy, describing the manners, customs, antiquities, paintings, etc. of that country in the years MDCCLXX and MDCCLXXI, to a friend residing in France*. Miller’s entry is indeed one of the longest in the *Dictionary* and her travel data is among the richest based on her published account, and further integrated with additional references to other sources. The format of her published account—organized by letters, each with the date and location of when and where it was written—provides clear and well-structured data. But of the more than thirty places in Italy from which Anne Miller sent letters, only fifteen made it into the *Dictionary* and therefore into the *Explorer*—only reading the letters in full reveals all the other locations that she visited.\n\n[^30]: For two of these, though the *Dictionary*’s team recovered more information. Of [Robert Talbot](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4673) (travel dates 1753), recorded in Capua on March 11, 1753, his sister inquired by letter to James Russel in June of that year “whether her Brother be now alive at Rome”—Russel replied in July that he could get “no notice of him.” Of the writer and friend of Laurence Sterne, [John Hall Stevenson](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4536) (1718-1785, travel date 1753), it is known that he traveled on the Grand Tour after graduating from Cambridge in 1753, but the only known record in the *Dictionary* and the *Explorer* is his passing through Capua on January 26, 1753\n\nThese observations do not diminish the value of the spatial information collected in the *Dictionary* and retrieved as data in the *Explorer*, but they do constitute a caveat for how to consider and handle it. The visualizations, as much as the data on which they are based, represent only what is preserved—surviving only through many layers of records, each with its own mix of accidents and intentionality—as opposed to what might have been. Indeed, the map immediately tells readers much about the nature of the data itself and, with some careful examination, about the overall shape of the geography of travel in the eighteenth century.\n\nSimilar caveats apply when looking at the temporal dimension of the travel data, represented in full in the timeline in the lower band in fig x, where each bar totals the number of travelers for that year. This is again made possible by the astounding work the *Dictionary* does of stitching together information from disparate archives to reconstruct these eighteenth-century travels, filling in many gaps but also connecting overlapping uncertainties. In this timeline visualization some general patterns appear that are consistent with the consensus among scholars working on the Grand Tour. Over the course of the century, the number of travelers to Italy increases overall, but there are also lulls and spikes, many of which match vicissitudes surrounding the many wars during this period. Decreases in travel occurred during the War of the Austrian Succession of 1740-1748, the Seven Years’ War beginning in 1754, and the American War of Independence—which spread to Europe and the world—from 1775 to 1783. Spikes in travel occurred after the peace treaties of 1763 and 1783.\n\nDigital humanities often result in confirmation, by way of hard data, of what is already known. While this is often also a criticism of the limits of digital humanities, in this case it is all the more remarkable that the overall picture of the *Explorer* data—formed from thousands of disparate bits, and marked by absence and uncertainty—generally matches the ebbs and flows of history’s big events, such as wartime disruptions. Still, this observation mostly tells us about the data itself and its integrity. But interrogating the data at a granular level, beyond the abstraction of the graph, by way of looking at the individuals that in aggregate constitute the bars in the graph visualization, offers even more insight. \n\nThe most pronounced dip in the number of travelers for the second half of the century is  the bar for year 1781, when only thirty-nine travelers in the database are recorded as having arrived in Italy, compared with 127 three years before and 94 just a year later.[^6] It is tempting to correlate this dip in travel with the fallout of the Declaration of American Independence in 1776, when France allied with the newly independent United States and entered the war with Great Britain in 1778, joined by Spain the following year, and then the Dutch Republic. The Mediterranean became a war zone where armed merchant ships were granted rights to the cargo of any enemy ship taken as a prize (known as privateering). Indeed, this is the historical context for the story of the already mentioned British ship the *Westmorland*: it was one of hundreds of such “prizes,” captured by French ships, their cargo inventoried and put up for sale. The catalogue of the Westmorland has survived and its listing of the ship’s commercial goods alongside art, books, and prints sent home by travelers, both helped contemporary British travelers pursue their lost items, and more recently has offered scholars a veritable time capsule of granular information revealing what Grand Tour collections were like. This *Westmoreland* story is a very concrete moment documenting the relationship between the Grand Tour and contemporary wars. To a degree, the 1781 dip in traveler numbers gleaned from our data does likewise. \n\nWhat does a closer look at the data offer? For twenty-three of the thirty-nine travelers reported to have arrived in Italy that year we have some data and more context from the *Dictionary*.[^7] Two of these travelers arrived for their first tour: [George Bruce-Brudenell Bruce](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/655) (1762-1783), traveling at the age of nineteen with a tutor by the name of [Ferguson](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1691), and [Thomas Clarke](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/963) (b. around 1742), an older Grand Tourist, traveling extensively after retiring from a military career. Others arrived who had already gone on tours of Italy. For example, [John Hanger Coleraine](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1045) (1743-94) and [George James Cholmondeley](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/929) (1749-1827) did their Grand Tours when younger, but in 1781 they were following the magnetic [Elizabeth Bridget Armistead](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/119) (1750-1842) on her first trip to Italy. The sculptor [Anne Damer](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1279) (1748-1828) had first visited in 1779, but returned in 1781 for a second tour, this time accompanied by [Lady Campbell](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/783) (d. 1784). Also, the date on a small portrait of the collector [David Digues Latouche](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2850) (1729-1817), who had traveled before, places him in Rome at this time. A group of painters also arrived in 1781: [Robert Fagan](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1652) (1761-1816), [Charles Grignion](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2127) (1752-1804), [Thomas Pye](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4001) (fl. 1773-97), and [James Smith](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4414) (b. c. 1749-after 1797). Fagan and Grignion arrived together; the former had returned to London for one year but then came back to Italy for life, while the latter came as a gold medal winner and also stayed on for life. Pye and Smith, who might have visited earlier, then lived out their lives in Italy. Other travelers came to visit relatives: Thomas Jenkins, the painter, dealer and cicerone in Rome, is visited by his nephew [James](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2678); John Udny, the merchant, collector and British consul in Venice, is visited by a [son](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4896); and Horace Mann, the British representative in Florence, is visited by his nephew [Horatio](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3170) (1744-1814), who brought along his young daughter [Lucy](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3170.2).\n\nThe mere presence of all these travelers arriving in Italy in 1781 demonstrates that the war did not deter them, whether they were first-time visitors or returning. Indeed, recent research shows that the French government decided not to discourage British travel during wartime, given the economic benefits to the French economy. Balancing the quantitative and the granular allows one to think through individual choices in the context of larger patterns. One might also discern specific consequences of the war on the Grand Tour. For Mann in particular, the data allows us to observe that he reduced his usual yearly visit to his uncle to every other year during the span of the Anglo-French war. There is also a singular explicit mention of the war in relation to travelers arriving in 1781, concerning [Hon. Gen James Murray](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3492) (1719-94), the governor of Minorca beginning in 1774, who sailed into Leghorn on 31 August 1781; the entry notes that “he evacuated his family during the French siege.” In fact, the text of the *Dictionary* tells us that Murray brought, along with his pregnant wife [Anne Whitham](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3492.1) (c. 1761-1824) and [daughter](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3492.2), “about twenty other ladies.” Interrogating these absences and presences, and the individual trajectories that lie behind the bar charts, is a process that points beyond the simple use of data visualization for confirming known trends, and instead toward new findings and questions.\n\nMore insight into the interplay of the quantitative and the qualitative and the meaning of numbers and of missing data comes from considering the counting done by many eighteenth-century travelers themselves. Travel was about observing and describing—using words and measurements for sites and monuments, as well as quotes and references and thick descriptions for customs and events. Tourists also watched and counted other travelers, reporting their numbers in the letters and journals describing their journeys. [Joseph Atwell](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/154) (c.1696-1768, travel years 1729-30), the twenty-four year-old tutor to the twenty year-old [second Earl of Cowper](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1167) (1709-64, travel years 1729-30), reported in a June 1730 letter that there were “no less than 13” English in Florence. In letters to his mother during his first trip to Italy dated February 1734, [Richard Pococke](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3914) (1704-65, years of travel 1733-34, 1737, 1740-1), the future bishop, pioneering mountaineer, and explorer of the East, noted about forty English in Rome. In February 1753, [Lord North](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3596) (1732-92, travel years 1752-53), traveling with his stepbrother of the same age (the [2<sup>nd</sup> Earl of Dartmouth](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1300), 1731-1801, travel years 1752-53) along with their tutor [Christopher Golding](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1985) (c. 1710-after 1758, travel years 1752-53), reported, “There are about 40 of our nation in Rome reckoning females.” Diplomats also reported on traveler numbers. The British representative in Florence for almost five decades, [Horace Mann](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3169) (1706-86, travel years 1732-3, 1738-86) gave regular updates in his letters to [Horace Walpole](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4974) (1717-97, travel years 1739-41)—after all, the numerous travelers were a major reason for his occupation. Mann noted twelve British travelers on July 21, 1744, thirty-five in August 1751 (“a larger flight of woodcocks than has been seen in many years”) and thirty-seven on October 18, 1768. In December 1772, he noted that over a few weeks’ time, the number of English travelers had dropped from nearly sixty to twenty. In May 1792, [Lady Philippina Knight](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2803) (1726-1799, travel years 1778-1799) wrote from Rome that during the spring, “we have had a hundred and fifty English here.”\n\nEven these few instances of travelers counting travelers show an increase in how many traveled over the century. One also wonders how these counts match with the numbers in the *Explorer*. For example, how does a search in the *Explorer* database compare to Atwell’s “no less than 13 English” in Florence in June of 1730? Excluding Atwell ad the young Earl of Cowper, [Excluding Atwell and the young Earl of Cowper, the result of sixteen entries is a close match](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/explore/%7B%22travelPlace%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22and%22,%22uniques%22:%5B%7B%22_id%22:%22Florence%22%7D%5D%7D,%22travelDate%22:%7B%22startYear%22:%221730%22,%22endYear%22:%221730%22,%22startMonth%22:%226%22,%22endMonth%22:%226%22%7D%7D). Yet, looking more closely at these entries in the *Explorer* it seems that few if any of these travelers, beside Atwell and his charge, fit the profile of Grand Tourist. Many rather appear to be long-term residents, foreigners who found ways to make a living in Florence. In 1730 [John Collins](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1055) (fl. 1700-39, travel years c. 1713-39) and [Mrs Collins](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1055.1) (travel years c. 1713-1739) had been in Florence at that point for about fifteen years, where they ran a hotel ‘for the Englishman that travel.’ [Sir Thomas 4<sup>th</sup> Baron of Dereham](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/1365) (1679-1739, travel years 1701-39) was brought to Florence as a child and grew up there as a Catholic and Jacobite, attending to Medici interests. [Daniel Gould](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2034) (c. 1672-1732, c. 1702-1732) also lived in Italy, trying with mixed results for various consular appointments, as did [Brinley Skinner](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4377) (d. 1764, travel years 1724-34), whose father and grandfather had been British merchants in Italy. [Dennis Scully](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4276) (c. 1672-1732, travel years c. 1702-32) seems to have been another long-term resident, who appears in sources because of lawsuits and then his renting rooms to travelers. [William Joy](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2721) (1675-1734, travel years c. 1702-33))—originally a ship-carpenter from Kent—had been a performing strongman on the London stage who was then hired by the Grand Duke as his own strongman and came to reside in Florence for the next twenty years. [Thomas Tyrell](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4888) (d. 1753, travel years -1722-53), originally from Ireland, had been found by the Grand Duke as a child beggar in Prague and brought to Florence where he became a courtier. The sixteen people counted by the *Explorer* in Florence in 1730 also includes artists and craftsmen. [Charles Martin](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3205) (travel years 1728-52-), mentioned by many travelers and in diplomatic correspondence, was living in Florence as a painter and dealer. The two brothers Hugford, [Cosimo](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2563) (fl. 1729-56, travel years -1729-56-) and [Ignazio Enrico](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2566) (1703-78, travel years 1703-78), were also artists and dealers; their entire lives unfolded in Florence, where their father had moved from London to become watchmaker for the Grand Duke. [Laetitia Henrietta Martin](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/3210) (d. 1731, travel years 1719-31) had married the Florentine sculptor Alessandro Galileo in England and then moved back to Florence with him. Another British woman in Florence, [Anna St John](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4215.1) (d. 1739, travel years 1728-39), had married the Italian painter [Giuseppe Grisoni](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4215.2) (d. 1769, travel years 1728-69) while he was working in London, and in 1728 they came back to Florence together. [William Hoare](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/2446) (1707-92, travel years 1728-37), a student of Grisoni’s in London, came with them to spend ten years in Italy. [Oliver St Johns](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/4215) (c.1691-1749, c.1723-47-), Anna’s brother, seems to have moved to Florence even earlier; accounts of him as a disturbed ‘madman,’ who was institutionalized, pepper the correspondence between Horace Mann and Walpole from 1723 to around 1747.\n\nThere were likely more whom Atwell might well have counted and thus are lost to the database. Yet the question remains of whom among the sixteen he might have counted, if any. Reading through the entries, one wonders whether Atwell might not have counted the Irish, the Catholic, the women, the artists, the long-term residents. Behind most clean numbers and clear quantitative measures, counting always requires a decision about categories and dimensions, for Atwell just as for the makers of the *Dictionary* and, indeed, for our own data assemblage.  \n\nReading through the *Dictionary*’s entries raises the question of how these sixteen were identified and offers insights into different types of touring; further reading would offer even more. As for the data alone, a bar graph visualization of time spent in Florence for the sixteen of this study would not enable us to distinguish among them, per se, but more comes to the fore from looking at the various data dimensions for the travelers. For example, some occupation data already indicate people who might not count as typical tourists such as diplomats, an innkeeper, and a strongman, and likewise artists. \n\n[this goes in caption, not in main text; Breve—a tool developed at CESTA’s [explain] Humanities+Design lab—immediately reveals this unevenness:] \n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-10\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-10.png\" id=\"fig10\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap10\">\n\nFig 10. These static representations of the values in the data for the seventeen travelers in Florence in June 1730 show gaps in the data and their uneven distribution (created using Breve). It is apparent that for all travelers we have name and gender, but for only a few dates of birth and death, parents, or sources. Nor is the amount known about each traveler evenly incremental: for example, we might have sources and parents but not date of birth.\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nClose attention to the data, however, leads to rewarding insights. The *Dictionary*’s entry for Thomas Dereham is among the longest—in the top 5%—but while it underlines his role as an influential Jacobite presence and art collector in Italy, it does not mention his life-long correspondence with the Royal Society on a number of scientific topics. By paying attention to the *Explorer*’s societies data for Dereham, though, which records his Royal Society fellowship, one is pointed to his scientific interests. There are also ways to examine and visualize the data that get one closer to interpretative questions. If for example one visualizes the data to show duration of tours, Atwell and Earl of Cowper emerge quickly as the outliers. While they are so richly attested in other types of data, they are also the ones who spent the least time in Florence. This shorter time spent sets these two Grand Tourists apart from the long-term resident—everyone else stays much longer, including visiting artists. But then again the question arises of ‘whose Grand Tour?.’ How do we account for these British travelers who end up staying much longer in Florence? How much a part of the Grand Tour world are they? After all, the inn-keepers Collins’ daughter, [Anna Maria Collins](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/398.1), born in Florence, ended up marrying a visiting [Grand Tourist](https://grandtourexplorer.wc.reclaim.cloud/#/entries/398) and moving back with him to London to participate fully in a post-Grand Tour life.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-11\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-11.png\" id=\"fig11\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap11\">\n\nFig 11. visualization of travel data as spans of time for their overall time in Italy for the seventeen travelers in Florence in June 1730, with dates for reference on the axis below.\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nHistorical data—that ‘saber-teethed tiger’—is most revealing when approached with a systematic interest in understanding its gaps as well as its interconnectedness. When downloading the *Explorer* data and separating it from its original context, it is most important to keep in mind its sources and the meaning and character of its original categorization. Only then can one use the data to make new connections and interpretations. The visualization below illustrates this point further. This graph of Parallel Sets[^8] visualizes the whole data set of travelers at a glance in terms of four dimensions: 1) biographical dates—birth, death, either, or neither; 2) origin of the entry—whether the traveler had an entry in the original print *Dictionary* or had one newly created for the *Explorer*; 3) occupation and education— that is, data concerning one or the other, both or none of these dimensions; 4) how many visits to places are recorded in the travelers’ data. This visualization presents only one set of categories and in one particular order, but the principle of interconnectedness, and of gaps, in the data, is the key takeaway.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-12\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-12.png\" id=\"fig12\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap12\">\n\nFig 12. This parallel sets visualization shows variation in the distribution of four categories (biographical data, origins of the entries, occupation and education, number of visits) in the data sets, highlighting the significance of these intersections to understand what data exists for the 6005 travelers in the database. The thickness of each curved line represents a quantity that is repeatedly subdivided by category, while the colors represent gender.  INTERACTIVE online version: [https://observablehq.com/d/3a4b9f6723517ec7](https://observablehq.com/d/3a4b9f6723517ec7)  \n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nFor example, immediately apparent is the solid chunk of travelers who are best documented—that is, travelers for whom we have most information, across the four dimensions, and who are by and large men. These are most likely the more typical elite Grand Tourists, for most of whom we know dates of birth and death, as well as much about their lives (for example, occupation and education), and who have better recorded tours with multiple places visited. But what is also immediately apparent, and perhaps more surprising, is how many travelers (as many as two-fifths of the whole set) are shown in the recorded data to have only visited one place. This surely reflects gaps in the data; however, it is essential to appreciate that, for many, we have additional information in other categories, and thus to realize that these travelers nevertheless have something to tell us about the world of the Grand Tour. Engaging interactively with this visualization reveals, for example, there are four women for whom the data records \n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-13\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-13.png\" id=\"fig13\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap13\">\n\nFig 13.\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-14\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-14.png\" id=\"fig14\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap14\">\n\nFig 14.\n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nboth biographical dates and occupation data, but one woman for whom we have only date of death and occupation date. Nevertheless, this woman traveler ranks among the better documented, with between 6 and 25 place visits recorded.\n\nAnother important category is that of source of entry. The parallel sets visualization shows that a clear majority of the entries—4879 out of 6005—are from the original *Dictionary*. But 222 are “newly created from headings;” these are the cases when entries that pertained to multiple travelers in the *Dictionary* were turned into individual entries for each traveler, changing the heading to reflect an individual traveler’s name, maintaining the same entry text as in the original *Dictionary*, and curating the additional data for each by hand. The ‘newly created from narrative’ category—which includes 904 entries—pertain to travelers who were in the *Dictionary* but subsumed in others’ entries, most often women who appeared under the heading of their husbands. There is more to say about these newly created entries—the hidden figures of the *Dictionary* appear in other sections of the book—but for now note how these travelers who appeared only in the background in the *Dictionary* become part of the knowable world of the data. Although much less is known about many of these hidden figures—the great majority of them women—this data and the intersecting lines that animate it points us to new questions and tell us new stories. \n\n**1.5 DOING RESEARCH WITH THE *EXPLORER*: SEVEN SCHOLARS’ ESSAYS**\n\n*A World Made by Travel* shares Grand Tour data publicly, thus opening new research possibilities to all, while at the same time featuring several original studies conducted using the *Explorer* and its database. These were produced by researchers who specialize in areas of study related to the Grand Tour (domain-experts, to use data science parlance) as the *Explorer* was being created. A number of scholars whose research in various ways concerns eighteenth-century British travel to Italy accepted invitations to participate in two workshops held in 2016 and 2017. At these convenings, participants generously worked through research questions of their own while using the *Explorer*. Some were already familiar with digital humanities work, while for others this was the first experimentation with digital history and with the idea of working with data—all brought a deep knowledge of archives and of the historical world of the Grand Tour. The conversations during these workshops informed the final shape of the *Explorer* and also provided an opportunity to showcase how data work and data visualization can support original scholarship.\n\nThe essays included here powerfully demonstrate the varieties of new research made possible by the *Grand Tour Explorer*. Open access to the *Explorer*—both to the abilities to browse, search, and sort, and to the underlying database itself—will in time produce more and unexpected scholarly work, yet some features of what such research may look like are already apparent. The intensity of engagement with the data itself varies greatly; some scholars rely more on word-searching, for example, and some research questions are better addressed through only a subset of the 6,005 travelers. All studies show the importance of contextualizing the work done with the *Explorer*’s data through further research and careful engagement with primary sources and the secondary literature. The newly populated world of travelers made accessible by the *Explorer*, which makes equally observable and searchable both elite and non-elite travelers and which includes under-documented as well as previously hidden figures, has encouraged research about travelers who were less visible before this digital transformation. The scholars’ essays in *A World Made by Travel*—alongside the study of architects that my team and I published in 2017 in the American Historical Review—[^31] are the first to use the *Explorer*. Taken together, these essays show that scholars have used the *Explorer* to look for unexplored facets of the world of the Grand Tour—seeking the Italians, for example, or focusing on specific types of (non-elite) travel or traveler, or on specific activities and interactions. In some cases, scholars have done so by looking at large numbers, and in others, by focusing on smaller sets—all exemplify deep historical work, by engaging with the *Explorer*’s data (whether about a handful, or tens, or hundreds of travelers) in combination with an exploration of context and sources beyond its bounds, and collectively illuminating numerous new facets of eighteenth-century travel to Italy.\n\n[^31]: Ceserani, Giovanna, Giorgio Caviglia, Nicole Coleman, Thea De Armond, Sarah Murray, and Molly Taylor-Poleskey. “British Travelers in Eighteenth-Century Italy: The Grand Tour and the Profession of Architecture.” *The American Historical Review* 122, no. 2 (April 2017): 425-450.\n\nIn her essay on [Ciceroni and their Clients](https://ceserani.github.io/gt-book/scholars-essays/paul-ciceroni-and-their-clients), Carol Paul, a scholar deeply interested in the relationship between people and the art they experience in museums or public spaces, examines another understudied figure in the world of the Grand Tour, that of the ciceroni who guided tourists around sites and educated them about these places’ history and art.[^32] Searching in the *Explorer*, using word search combined with mentioned names, various linking, and other dimensions, Paul finds fifteen ciceroni, twelve of whom have their own entries in the *Explorer*, and she identifies 142 of their clients among the *Explorer*’s travelers. While acknowledging that there were many more clients, and also more ciceroni, Paul’s systematic examination of the data for the group she has identified nonetheless leads to a fuller sense of the careers of the ciceroni and of the types of clients who employed them.\n\n[^32]: For Paul’s work in this field, see her *The First Modern Museums of Art: The Birth of an Institution in 18th- and Early-19thCentury Europe* (Los Angeles: The J. Paul Getty Museum, 2012), and more recently “The Art World of the European Grand Tour,” in Stacey Sloboda and Michael Yonan, eds., *Eighteenth-Century Art Worlds: Global and Local Geographies of Art* (New York and London: Bloomsbury Visual Arts, 2019), 191-208, and “Between Public and Private: Antiquities Collections in Early Modern Rome,” for Richard Thomas and Jeffrey Henderson, eds., *James Loeb, The Collector and Connoisseur: Proceedings of the Second James Loeb Biennial Conference*, Munich and Murnau, 6-8 June 2019 (forthcoming, Cambridge, MA and London: Harvard Univ. Press, 2022), 27-53.\n\nOther scholars ask questions across the whole dataset. Sophus Reinert, an economic historian who considers travel in the context of emergent capitalism and international competition, went looking in the *Explorer* for “the economic Grand Tour.”[^33] [*Mapping the Economic Grand Tour: Travel and Emulation in Enlightenment Europe*](https://ceserani.github.io/gt-book/scholars-essays/reinert-economic-grand-tour) is the result of his search for travelers whose journeys attest to economic interests, ranging from merchants to early economic thinkers. Reinert finds evidence to argue for distinct patterns in the data for these Grand Tourists, while making the case for why these types of travelers need to be accounted for in order to understand fully eighteenth-century travel to Italy. In [*Who Traveled, Where and When?: Using the Grand Tour Explorer to Examine Patterns of Travels and Travelers*](https://ceserani.github.io/gt-book/scholars-essays/sweet-who-traveled), Rosemary Sweet extends her distinct interest in urban centers and tourists’ experiences to consider cities beyond the top five that her previous work illuminated, using *Explorer* data on travel to Turin, Milan, Genoa, Livorno/Leghorn, and Bologna.[^34] Building on the travel data for these cities, Sweet probes patterns of representation in the *Explorer*’s data, integrating these findings with her deep knowledge of eighteenth-century travel accounts, both published and in manuscript. She detects that women came to surpass young men in the numbers of recorded travelers by the last decades of the century.\n\n[^33]: Among the relevant Reinert publications, see Reinert, Sophus A. [\"Another Grand Tour: Cameralism and Antiphysiocracy in Tuscany, Baden, and Denmark-Norway\"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-7497-6_4) in *Physiocrats, Antiphysiocracy and Pfeiffer*, edited by Jurgen Backhaus, 39–69. And see Springer, 2011, for his specific engagement with the question of economic Grand Tour before the *Explorer*.\n[^34]: For the larger context to this research, see Sweet’s *Cities and the Grand Tour. The British in Italy, c. 1690-1820* (2012).\n\nOther essays move from individual figures to probe large questions. Melissa Calaresu’s research has long focused on recovering and understanding the Italian (and particularly the Neapolitan) presence in the European Enlightenment.[^35] In [*Life and Death in Naples: Thomas Jones and Urban Experience in the Grand Tour (Explorer)*](https://ceserani.github.io/gt-book/scholars-essays/calaresu-life-and-death), Calaresu focuses on the painter Thomas Jones’ deep relationship with Italy’s people and with its urban and domestic life, finding in the *Explorer* traces of engagement beyond the touristic mode. Calaresu uses the length of time spent traveling as a significant measure of travelers’ engagement with a place, and thus rewrites travel patterns and their assumed meaning. Catherine Sama, in [*Going Digital: Re-Searching Connections Between Rosalba Carriera and British Grand Tourists*](https://ceserani.github.io/gt-book/scholars-essays/sama-rosalba-carriera), also turns to the Italian-British divide, drawing on her expertise on women in early modern Venice.[^36] Sama focuses on Rosalba Carriera, who as an Italian artist did not gain an entry in the *Dictionary*; using mentioned names and their networks, she reconstructs a full set of relations to better understand Carriera’s life and work, including discovering new sources describing her studio in Venice. In [*Harlequin Horsemanship: Non-Grand Tourists on the Grand Tour (Explorer)*](https://ceserani.github.io/gt-book/scholars-essays/macdonald-harlequin-horsemanship), Simon MacDonald, an expert on transnational history and particularly on British people living abroad in early modern Europe, builds on his discovery in the archives of one British equestrian showman in Italy by using the *Explorer* to look for more.[^37] The resulting dataset enables MacDonald to construct a new historical narrative of British equestrian shows in Italy, while also reflecting on the archival possibilities and limitations built into the *Explorer itself*. Finally Rachel Midura, in [*The British Arrival in Italy*](https://ceserani.github.io/gt-book/scholars-essays/midura-british-arrival), builds on her expertise in postal routes, transnational history, and data science to posit tourists’ possible access routes into Italy. Despite data limitations, Midura models sophisticated data analysis tying relations between infrastructure growth and travel patterns to historical developments.[^38]\n\n[^35]: Most recently, see 'Cosmopolitanism and the creation of patriotic identities in the late European enlightenment: The case of Pietro Napoli-Signorelli and his Storia critica de’ teatri antichi e moderni', in Joan-Pau Rubiés and Neil Safier (eds), *Cosmopolitanism and Enlightenment* (Cambridge University Press, 2023), pp. 208-238, and among earlier publciations, see ‘Collecting Neapolitans: The representation of street life in late eighteenth-century Naples’, in Melissa Calaresu and Helen Hills (eds), *New approaches to Naples c.1500-c.1800: The power of place* (Farnham: Ashgate, 2013), 175-202,‘Costumes and customs in print: Travel, ethnography and the representation of street-sellers in early modern Italy’, in Joad Raymond, Jeroen Salman, and Roeland Harms (eds), *‘Not dead things’: The dissemination of popular print in England and Wales, Italy, and the Low Countries, 1500-1900* (Leiden: Brill, 2013), pp.181-209, and ‘The Enlightenment in Naples’, in Tommaso Astarita (ed), *A companion to early modern Naples* (Leiden/Boston: Brill, 2013), 405-426.\n[^36]: See her “Luisa Bergalli e le sorelle Carriera: un rapporto d’amicizia e di collaborazione professionale,” in *Luisa Bergalli poetessa drammaturga traduttrice critica letteraria*, edited by Adriana Chemello (Mirano-Venice: Eidos, 2008), 59-75, “‘On Canvas and on the Page’:” Women Shaping Culture in Eighteenth-Century Venice,” in *Italy’s Eighteenth Century: Gender and Culture in the Age of the Grand Tour*, edited by Paula Findlen, Wendy Roworth, and Catherine M.

The most significant benefit of the transformation of the *Dictionary* into the *Explorer*, along with foregrounding the *Dictionary*’s hidden figures, is not so much the *total mass* of data it makes available as much as the *Explorer* data’s density of information, the systematic nature of the categories that organize its information, and the clarity about its boundaries and limits as an information dataset. Researchers see, as if for the first time, what has remained stubbornly uncertain about the Grand Tour. Criss-crossing between datasets facilitates new questions and new interpretations, but knowledge of the original sources and archives, and *context*—that sticky historiographical concept—remain the key to approaching this information. \n\n**1.6. *A WORLD MADE BY TRAVEL* AND DIGITAL HISTORY**\n\nTogether with colleagues in the Mapping the Republic of Letters Project at Stanford University (the umbrella project from which the origins of *A World Made by Travel* emerged), I first wrote about the possibilities and challenges of doing historical research in the digital age in 2017. We reflected on questions about working with historical sources as data in a time of rapid digitization and datafication, and about working with printed and some archival material that was becoming available online as jpeg, pdf, html texts, and metadata shared by repositories. Also under discussion was the multifaceted richness of early modern historical data, traversing time and space and connecting people, and of how this richness coexisted with the inherently incomplete nature of this type of data. We stood by our dedication to the interplay between the quantitive and qualitative as essential and we hoped to refine the concept of “big data” such that it would take into account interconnectedness rather than merely size and number. We discussed our filtering, plotting, measuring, parsing, and visualizing of information as data; and our experience stepping back and observing this data’s contours and how this also prompted us to take a closer look at underlying patterns and forgotten figures, while remaining aware of that data’s fragmentary character. In the air was a possible future in which scholars could seamlessly share and analyze one another’s findings, the promise of using linked data to identify overlaps clearly and easily with existing datasets and to interact with new ones.[^39]\n\n[^39]: See Edelstein, Dan, Paula Findlen, Giovanna Ceserani, Caroline Winterer and Nicole Coleman.\n“Historical Research in a Digital Age: Reflections from the Mapping the Republic of Letters Project,” *The American Historical Review*, Volume 122, Issue 2, April 2017, 400-24. [https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/122.2.400](https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/122.2.400)\n\nNow, just a few years later and on the other side of the social and technological ruptures entailed by a global pandemic and the spectacular rise of AI, the concept of data is at the forefront of essential conversations more than ever, both in the academy and beyond. Three major journals in their respective humanities fields (*History and Theory*, *Critical Inquiry*, and *New Literary History*) have published special issues about data in 2022 and 2023, just as the publication of *A World Made by Travel* was underway. From megabyte to zettabyte, the exponential growth of data represents a new structural condition, and the constructed nature of data is at the core of reflections about history in the digital age. Drawing a contrast with earlier forms of cliometrics, Claire Lemercier and Claire Zalc, for example, calling themselves ‘alternative quantifiers’ emphasize and embrace the messiness of data, pointing to the interrogation of assemblages’ layers with the ambition of not just exploring what is missing, but considering how different layers overlap, and how outliers can reveal specific forms of interaction among categories. The ongoing growth of data as both an object of discourse and as an epistemology in its own right, a way to think, seems to pose these questions even more urgently than in 2017. Indeed, it is increasingly urgent to highlight the act of counting as an active historiographical act—not merely a passive means of registering information but rather a powerful way (for better and for worse) of establishing categories and producing knowledge. \n\nThe work that *A World Made by Travel* makes public has been a distinct experiment in this effort. The *Explorer* was not “born digital,” nor does it use a given set of metadata, nor does it create data from scratch. At its core is a published prosopographical text, which is itself structured information. My team and I began by mining this text, but this work soon turned into something much larger, as the print *Dictionary* began to take new shape as a dynamic resource. This was a result of both digitization and “datafication,” involving a number of computational techniques as well as formalization, categorization, and interpretation performed iteratively and, to a large extent, collaboratively. Does the *Dictionary*’s structured information comprise “big data”? It may contain a larger set of travelers than have ever been studied at once before, but it falls far short of the size of any contemporary big data sets and also of the estimates for travel at the time. The richness of the *Explorer* data resides in its density rather than absolute size, and in its multidimensional, humanistic, and carefully curated nature. Its primary rewards, as with much rich historical data, are first and foremost in the patterns it reveals and the new questions it prompts.\n\nThe 6,005 travelers of the *Explorer* and the work of analysis and interpretation already done take their place in all these contemporary debates. Intriguingly, most sophisticated criticism of foundational publications in digital humanities now come from digital humanists themselves, rather than from critics of the digital humanities per se.[^40] What today seems to have been a nearly unfettered enthusiasm for macroanalysis and big data in earlier publications, a striving after objectivity, has given ground to data-intensive humanities projects that are historically situated and dedicated to the complexities of interpretation. A desire for the total corpus (always posited as happening in the future) has been replaced by a call for the careful curation of data, a recognition of the essential value of data editing (rather than quick dismissals of data cleaning), and a push for transparency in the documentation of dataset construction as well as practices of visualization and interpretation. In many ways, this emphasis on edition and curation for this new wave of digital humanities goes a long way to resolve what is now seen as too simplistic an opposition between close and distant reading.[^41]\n\n[^40]: In particular see Bode, K 2017, 'The Equivalence of \"Close\" and \"Distant\" Reading; or, Toward a New Object for Data-Rich Literary History', *Modern Language Quarterly*, vol. 78, no. 1, pp. 77-106.

For history in particular see, Lemercier and Zalc, 2022, and Guldi 2023, and Arhert, Arhert, Coleman and Weingart 2020, and Arhert 2023.\n[^41]: The conceptual formulation of the significance of multiple scales, rich data, and dense data—which all are at the core of the proposals by Bode, Klein, and Guldi—was heralded already in Boyd 2012. Note that Moretti himself, often posited as the originator of distant versus close reading, has reassessed that distinction in *Falso Movimento* (2022) where he resorts to the lessons of microhistory for the discussion.\n\n*A World Made by Travel* aligns with this evolution. From the start, the work on the *Grand Tour Explorer* was essentially concerned with problems of data set construction, and was committed to transparency about the transformation of the *Dictionary*’s information—as well as the *Dictionary*’s own various sources—into data. The digital categorizations adapted from the *Dictionary* required explanation, as did the many additional categories created for the *Explorer*, all of which are richly documented in *A World Made by Travel*. The idea of sharing data is inherent in the original print *Dictionary* as a reference work, and the Explorer carries this out in digital form.\n\nYet while the recent bibliography in this field has developed quickly, as has the accelerating pace of technology itself, it may be helpful to reach back a few decades to consider the place of digital history in the ebbs and flows of historiography itself. In 1991, Robert Rowland, in an essay entitled “L’informatica e il mestiere dello storico” (“Computer science and the historian’s craft”) for a special issue on “Informatica e Fonti Storiche” (Computer Science and Historical Sources), presented the computer as a solution to the disciplinary impasse between quantitative and qualitative history. He was thinking of ‘nominal record linkage’ for its ability to connect all sources relevant to the same individual, and thus to reconstruct relationships between people and groups.[^42] In the process, Rowland imagined a near future in which such a database could be processed at speed and shared easily among scholars. The coming and going of the minidisk (which seemed futuristic to Rowland) and the advent of the cloud have provided new means for rapidly processing and sharing large amounts of data, at rates unimaginable in 1991. But the bridging of the micro and the macro, of the local and the global, which are central issues for any discussion concerned with the relation between quantitative and qualitative in historical research, remains a work in progress- and a huge topic of discussion—in historiography at large, and the ability to link data has yet to be refined.[^43]\n\n[^42]: Rowland, Robert. “L’informatica e il mesteriere dello storico.” *Quaderni Storici* 26, no. 78 (3) (1991): 693–720. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/43778272](http://www.jstor.org/stable/43778272). For ‘nominal record linkage’ see page 704.\n[^43]: The question precedes debates in digital history of course—more than a decade before Rowland’s piece see for example Ginzburg and Poni 1979. For a most recent and thoughtful reflection on issues of scale, both temporal and spatial, and of scope of work and methods, see Trivellato 2023—again a work not focused on digital history per se but that provides the unavoidable larger historiographical context. \n\nThere is no denying that, as the digital has become part of so many scholars’ work (even of those who do not identify as digital humanists), much has changed in historical research. Emma Rothschild has recently shared a poignant and insightful account of doing historical research in our digital age. In her 2021 *An Infinite History*, Rothschild produces a multiscale history by following up on the eighty-three signatures opposed to a 1764 prenuptial document in the provincial town of Angoulême. Rothschild expands this initial group of signatories into a network of four thousand individuals, whose lives allow her to move the story forward through decades and centuries as a record of deep social and economic change—the making of historical time. When she describes her research, moving from the archives to online searching, adding information bit by bit in the course of reconstructing the lives of thousands of individuals “glimpsed out of the corner of the eye, or at the edge of the screen,” she underlines the importance of online research possibilities, while also speaking honestly about the solitude of such digital work. She also recalls how these very possibilities raised questions—about the scale of what is left undigitized, for instance, and the biases that defined this division, as well as the biases of the search algorithms themselves.[^44] Lara Putnam, in her 2016 AHR article *The Transnational and the Text-Searchable*, had already explored some of these biases as well. Putnam describes the digital age’s new shadows, which exclude those (especially from the Global South) whose histories never were digitized and likely never will be. These kinds of questions—about how we do this work now as scholars, or about worldwide inequities in archival preservation, or about the shifting historical concept of context as a solution to the opposition between the large-scale and the granular—are all relevant to the prosopographical database of the *Explorer*.\n\n[^44]: Emma Rothschild, *Infinite History*, 9, and Lara Putman, 2016.\n\n*The World Made by Travel*’s foregrounding of unrepresented or hidden figures brings them out of the shadows and back from the edge of the screen. By poring over missing data and inconsistencies in the original print *Dictionary*, by working to reconcile the presence of obscure names and identities, by going beyond the most famous and recognizable Grand Tourists whose stories have been told again and again, the project takes up the words of Virginia Woolf in her 1939 essay *The Art of Biography*, “whether the lives of great men only should be recorded”: “Is not anyone who has lived a life, and left a record of that life, worthy of biography — the failures as well as the successes, the humble as well as the illustrious? And what is greatness? And what smallness?” Woolf’s words are particularly resonant because one can perceive them in relation to contemporary debates on the first *Dictionary of National Biography* and its scope. Leslie Stephen, Woolf’s father, had raised such questions as editor of the *Dictionary of National Biography* when he observed that it would be ‘the second-rate people’, ‘the less conspicuous people about whom it is hard to get information elsewhere’, whose lives needed ‘to be reconstructed from obituary notices or from references in memoirs and collections of letters’, who would ‘prove the real test of the value of the book’.[^45]\n\n[^45]: Woolf 1939, and Stephens 1896. See also Carter 2019. \n\nLikewise, one of the tests of our project’s value has been our historical research on “the less conspicuous people” who populate its many digital pages. Turning once again to our eighteenth British travelers in Florence in June of 1730, only four out of those are in the new digital *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography*: William Joy, the strongman known as “The English Sampson,” is one of these, along with three artists: the two Hugford brothers, who are combined into a single entry, and the portrait painter William Hoare. Even for William Joy and William Hoare, though, there is no information about the time they spent in Italy—a divide of national historiographical traditions, alongside that between South and North, persisting in the more connected digital age.\n\nAltogether, the *ODNB* covers 20,000 lives from the eighteenth century, which makes the 6,005 travelers documented in the *Explorer* a good number for comparison. Proportionally, the *Explorer* has many more women and travelers employed in the service of others, but it also contains relatively little information about them. Linked data, as envisioned with colleagues from the Mapping the Republic of Letters project, retains the promise of making these comparisons across databases possible, which was a mere wish in 1991, when the processing and transferring of data was a fraction of what is possible today. However, it will remain hard work for the foreseeable future. Jason Kelly offered the insightful suggestion, for example, of cross-referencing the database of the *Explorer* and the database created by the *Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slavery to bring the world of British travel into illuminating dialogue with the imperial economy of slavery, which was a major engine in the economy of travel to Italy*.[^46] *Again, there is nothing yet automatic about such a process, but it entails* far more than just cross-checking names, requiring time to reconcile names and people across generation. Charles Abbot, for example, had definite ties to the plantation economy, but these ties would never be made apparent by computational checking of names alone across the two databases—linked data and total unique identifiers are yet to materialize as hoped for since the early 1990s at least.\n\n[^46]: See Kelly 2017.\n\nOne approach that is emerging with new force from digital history is that of collective biographies, which in aggregate and with new archival digitization encompasses  far more figures than previously known. Ruth Anhert, for example, is mining the dataset that she curated out of State papers, specifically Tudor correspondences, with its more than twenty thousand identified individuals to reconstruct a collective biography of the middlemen of the Tudors’ intelligence service, most of whom are not figures that have previously entered the historiographical narratives. There are new historiographical possibilities here at play. While the prosopography of the *Explorer*, like that of the *ODNB*, is not exhaustive, unlike the *ODNB*, the *Explorer*’s choice of who to remember is not based on perceived significance; rather it is based solely on the fact of having traveled in Italy and having left behind a trace in one of the soruces examined by the *Dictionary*’s team. Even in smaller sets and aggregates, such as the sixty-nine architects of the first case study published with *Explorer* data, this realizes a powerful promise of collective biography. In counting, as for example in the case of the sixty-nine architects, both those who succeeded and those who did not, those who died in Italy along with those who moved elsewhere, those who went willingly as well as those who went under some form of duress, the *Explorer* gets us closer to the history not just of who has been deemed worthy of remembrance, but to the fuller potentiality of the past. Sabina Loriga has advocated for collective biography as a historiographical space where “what matters is variety,” since “only a multitude of experiences” enable “consideration [of] two fundamental dimensions of history, that is conflicts and potentiality.”[^47] The aggregates of the *Explorer*’s travelers—the interconnecting of various biographical and travel dimensions, even of those for whom little information is known— might just allow us to tell of a more inclusive story of the Grand Tour with new scope and meanings.\n\n[^47]: Sabina Loriga, ‘La biographie comme probleme,’ in J. Revel, *Jeux d'echelles. La microanalyse a l'expérience*, Gallimard, 2006 , 230-31.\n\n**1.7 A CLASSICAL CODA**\n\nA decade after the *Tribuna of the Uffizi*, a canvas simultaneously so crowded and so empty, Johan Joseph Zoffany painted the British collector Charles Townley surrounded by his favorite items and in conversation with friends. Another group portrait in conversational style, this famous painting once again shows elite British males with classical antiquities, but ones that have been transplanted on British soil. Townley was indeed then amassing what would become one of the largest collections to end up in Britain. All the pieces in the painting are accurately depicted and easily recognizable, but for the fact that Zoffany imaginatively assembled them so as to crowd the library; at the time, they were actually housed in downstairs rooms, with ample space for Townley to invite public viewings. This intimate library scene has become a favorite to represent the collecting of ancient art and the passion for antiquity that animated British eighteenth-century culture. Viccy Coltman, though, has recently dug deeper into this picture of striking contrast between the colorfully dressed elite males and the pale and lucent stone objects and naked marble statues among and around them. Putting Zoffany’s picture in relation to a similar scene that the painter Richard Cosway captured several years earlier in ‘Townley and connnoisseurs: lecture of Venus’ arse,’ as well as various contemporary correspondences, Coltman highlights the homosocial and erotic tensions underlying both scenes, connecting the famous library conversation group and the lewder one by Cosway, under the rubric ‘sex and the antique.’[^48] Yet again, a crowded scene in which also much is missing, from the women (distinguished travel companions and also sex workers) to the intermediaries, to those able to transport the works from Italy back to England. This, though, is the story of how ancient art came into classical studies. \n\n[^48]: Viccy Coltman, “‘The Lecture on Venus’s Arse’; Richard Cosway’s ‘Charles Townley with a Group of Connoisseurs’, c.1771-5,” in *Classical Sculpture and the Culture of Collecting in Britain since 1760* (Oxford University Press, 2009).\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-15\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-15.png\" id=\"fig15\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap15\">\n\nFig 15.

He moved to Rome precisely because it was the favored destination for artists from all over Europe, on account of both its art and ancient remains as well as the crowds of tourists—and possible patrons—it attracted. Here he became one of the most influential visual interpreters of Italy’s antiquity, shaping its imagination and study in ways that reverberate still today.[^49] His engravings, highly sought after by Grand Tourists for their visionary character, continue to raise questions of scale and representation that go to the heart of the Grand Tour, and of Classics as a discipline. As a recent Morgan Library exhibition has shown, Piranesi chose to insert into these engravings real people that he observed and drew himself, whether they were workers in his print shop or people he encountered on the street.[^50]\n\n[^49]: For a most recent and concise assessment of this legacy see Susan Tallman, “The Perpetual Provocateur,” *The New York Review*, May 11, 2023, [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2023/05/11/the-perpetual-provocateur-giovanni-battista-piranesi/](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2023/05/11/the-perpetual-provocateur-giovanni-battista-piranesi/)\n[^50]: See Susan Tallman, “The Perpetual Provocateur,” *The New York Review*, May 11, 2023, [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2023/05/11/the-perpetual-provocateur-giovanni-battista-piranesi/](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2023/05/11/the-perpetual-provocateur-giovanni-battista-piranesi/); John Marciari, *Sublime Ideas: Drawings by Giovanni Battista Piranesi* (University of Chicago Press, 2023).\n\nOne place that Piranesi returned to again and again was Cestius’ Pyramid in Rome, where he used the human figure both to measure the physical scale of the monument and to suggest, metaphorically, the immense scale of history.[^51] \n\n[^51]: On Piranesi and the Cestius Pyramid, see “Piranesi,” *Piranesi in Rome*, [https://omeka.wellesley.edu/piranesi-rome/exhibits/show/pyramidgc/piranesi/](https://omeka.wellesley.edu/piranesi-rome/exhibits/show/pyramidgc/piranesi/); John Wilton-Ely, *The Mind and Art of Giovanni Battista Piranesi* (London: Thames and Hudson, 1978), 31-40.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-17\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-17.png\" id=\"fig17\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap17\">\n\nFig 17. \n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nTwo and a half centuries later, the African-American multi-media artist Carrie Mae Weems arrived at the same site during her time as a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome in 2006, in the ongoing tradition of artists going on the Grand Tour. Hailed for beautifully arresting and haunting works such as *The Kitchen Table* series, the *Louisiana Project*, and the recent retrospective entitled *Witness*—all of which turn an explicitly Black gaze on the fraught history of the US—Weems created her series *Roaming* by photographing various Italian sites from Rome as far south as Matera. Always in black and white, her images invariably include in the frame the solitary figure of a Black woman as seen from behind in a long black dress.\n\n<figure>\n\n<a name=\"figure-18\"> <img src=\"ceserani-figure-18.png\" id=\"fig18\" class=\"fig\" onclick=\"zoom(this, null, getElementById(&apos;cap1&apos;))\"/> </a>   \n\n<figcaption id=\"cap18\">\n\nFig 18. \n    \n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nIn Weems’s own words: “I call her my muse—but it’s safe to say that she’s more than one thing. She’s an alter-ego. My alter-ego, yes . . . this woman can stand in for me and for you; …she leads you into history. She’s a witness and a guide. . . .”[^52] Weems’ image of Cestius’ Pyramid directly evokes the many eighteenth-century images like Piranesi’s that documented Rome’s monuments with quasi-photographic precision and deliberately set the diminutive human figure in relation to those monuments. And perhaps Weems’s muse can serve as a guide for re-scaling the history of classical travel, inspiring the recovery of previously obscured or forgotten figures within that history. At a moment when the Humanities and Classics want to expand their reach and become more inclusive, digital tools that allow us to glimpse the many thousands of people, humble as well as illustrious, who roamed among Italy’s antiquities—if used thoughtfully and with an allowance for absence and uncertainty—might be one way forward. \n\n[^52]: In Dawoud Bey, “Carrie Mae Weems,” *BOMB Magazine*, 109, July 1, 2009, [https://bombmagazine.org/articles/carrie-mae-weems/](https://bombmagazine.org/articles/carrie-mae-weems/).

        "content"  : "My interest in the Grand Tour explorer arises out of my own work on the engagement of British travelers with Italian cities during the long eighteenth century. Some years ago, I published a book that concentrated upon British experiences and representations of Italian cities during the long eighteenth century, Cities and the Grand Tour: The British in Italy, c. 1690-1820.1 As an urban historian, I was less concerned with what was collected or purchased by travelers, or with their social networks, than with exploring how images of major Italian cities were constructed and considering their influence in British culture. Given the opportunity to work with the Grand Tour Explorer, I wanted to use it to pursue several questions.</p>\n\nLike many historians, years of immersion in the primary sources meant that I had an intuitive sense of evolving patterns of travel and the composition of the traveling body. However, I was unable to provide any rigorous quantifiable basis for my conclusions or generalizations. How far were my generalizations borne out by the evidence of the Explorer, while taking into account the complex nature of its data, which we know to be far from complete (see the introduction of the book)? What new light could the Explorer cast on my own qualitative and more impressionistic research by providing more granular and accurate snapshots of topics such as itineraries, numbers of travelers, or duration of stay? What could the Explorer tell us about the changing social composition of tourists, shifts in the gender ratio, and patterns in the age cohort of the traveling body? The dominant paradigm of the Grand Tour is that of the aristocratic young man, sent to Italy to finish his education and to prepare him socially for a life of political and cultural leadership, whose taste, acquired and polished in Italy, exercised such a powerful influence upon Britain’s eighteenth-century cultural life through patronage of artists and architects.2 But it was also clear from my own research in both published and unpublished sources that traveling alongside such young men were a diverse range of other individuals, whose recorded experience had become subsumed within that of an archetypal aristocratic grand tourist. One of the themes that I had tried to draw out throughout my book was the increasing presence of both female travelers and travelers from beyond the landed elite over the course of the eighteenth century, and the Explorer provided the opportunity to test this thesis. Finally, because I had focused very heavily on the four major cities of the Italia tour in my book: Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, I was interested to see what light the Explorer might cast both on the dominance exercised by these cities in the Grand Tour as an institution, and the significance of other centers with a lower profile: such as Turin, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Genoa and Leghorn.\n"
