00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This interactive graph allows readers to seek particular information about individual architects and associations related to their architectural interests and
pursuits.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
For forty-two architects, we have data of affiliation to various societies and academies.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We group these eighteen associations into four categories of British artist societies, British learned societies, Italian societies, and other national
societies.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The graph reveals both particular information and aggregated trends.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Only William Chambers populates all four categories of academies and societies, while only three others--George Dance the Younger, Robert Mylne, and Robert
Adam--populate three categories, and they all miss the same fourth other national societies.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But understanding the data means remembering that John Talman, who counts only one affiliation, lived before any of the British art societies in our dataset were
established.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Besides Chambers, Andrew Fountaine is the only one associated with a foreign non-Italian academy.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The amount of data is similar for the amateurs and professionals, but all the amateurs together populate only two categories and were it not for Fountaine's lone
affiliation to other national academies, all belong to that of British learned societies.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
These quantitative measures speak to wider stories of professionalization and social dynamics.
