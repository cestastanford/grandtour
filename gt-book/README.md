# gt-book

Once you have the .zip file "gt-book" follow the instructions from Giorgio:

'''
However, you will need to run a couple of commands to be able to run and see the website.

In theory, it should not take too long.. I will put some instructions below, but please let me know if you have issues or questions.

- If you donâ€™t have Jekyll installed, you should first install it. Jekyll requires Ruby... You can find info on how to install the whole thing here: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
- After that, you should be able to get into the folder I shared and run the following command:

bundle exec jekyll serve

This should start a server with the website running at http://localhost:4000/

The website contains very little real content but the structure and links should work.

Important dev note:
Much of the site links are hardcoded with a "/gt-book/" baseurl, which is necessary for the GitHub Pages site to work. This will need to be adapted for the final host.
