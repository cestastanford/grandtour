      <i>A World Made by Travel</i> is a digital publication and it integrates dynamically function and content. 
      Clicking on the table of contentsâ€™s sections titles here to the left will  show the subsections--chapters and essays--and in turn clicking on each of these will pull them up for reading. 
      You can leave all subsections of the table of contents open, or close each by clicking on its title again; to download the full table of contents as a PDF click on the download sign in the top right corner. 
      Once reading has taken you to scroll further down, to get back to the table of contents click on the arrow sign at the bottom. 
      Below this arrow sign is a red auburn that opens up in a new tab the <i>Grand Tour Explorer</i>, the interactive database that is part and parcel with the book. 
      The red auburn hyperlinks in the text also click to open up in new tabs the relevant sections in the <i>Grand Tour Explorer</i>. 
      The golden yellow hyperlinks instead open to relevant sections within the text of <i>A World Made by Travel</i> itself. 
      There are no page numbers in this digital publication but when you hover on any paragraph you will see its number, alongside signs to cite and link the paragraph. 
      The download sign seen when hovering next to chapters' and essays' titles and in the pop up version of data images and their captions, allows you to access PDF version of all this content for ease of print. 
      All citations and PDF versions include reference and copyright information for <i>A World Made by Travel</i>.
