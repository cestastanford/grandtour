### Introduction

This section features seven original essays written by scholars whose research and expertise revolve around various aspects of eighteenth-century European and Italian history and culture. These scholars worked with the Grand Tour Explorer while it was still in development, during two workshops on the Stanford campus in 2016 and 2017, thus contributing to the iterative process of design and development of the Explorer itself. You can read each essay individually in this section (find the titles on the left side table of contents) but also read more about them collectively in &ldquo;[Doing Research with the Explorer: Seven Scholars’ Essays](https://aworldmadebytravel.supdigital.org/entering-a-world-made-by-travel#doing-research-with-the-explorer-seven-scholars-essays)&rdquo; in Section I).
